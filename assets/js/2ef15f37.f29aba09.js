Specifically we support DungeonRoute sims. Route sims are a new way to sim a Mythic+ dungeon that takes into account actual mobs in actual dungeons and assigns the actor a specific damage share of a pull. This gives you the ability to have much more accurate sims than previously for mythic+ environments."},"guides/guides":{"id":"guides/guides","title":"Guides","description":"General Shadow Priest guides can be found below:"},"guides/season3ptr":{"id":"guides/season3ptr","title":"Season 3 PTR Information","description":"This guide is a temporary one-stop-shop for all current PTR info for testing Shadow Priest.
