Let\u2019s break down what realistic expectations look like, and how your rotation and gear tie into sustaining long Voidforms.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Role of the Season 3 Set Bonus\\n**2-piece:** [Halos](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=120517/halo) generate an additional 10 Insanity over 5 sec and Resonant Energy additionally increases the damage of your [Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=335467/devouring-plague) by 5%.  \\n**4-piece:** While [Power Surge](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1236396/power-surge) is active, every 2 casts of Devouring Plague adds another Halo to the effect at 100% effectiveness, up to 2 times.\\n\\n### What this really means for Voidform uptime\\nYour Insanity comes from Halos now (a lot). Power Surge causes your cast Halo to echo at fixed intervals; with the 2-pc, each Halo instance injects an additional 10 Insanity over 5s. During Power Surge, that\u2019s multiple \u201cmini-batteries\u201d of Insanity that smooth your resource gain and make long Voidforms realistic. \\n\\nWith the 4-pc, landing 4 Devouring Plagues during Surge adds up to two extra Halos, juicing Insanity even more. I have made a Weak Aura to help you track this that is also included in my Shadow Priest pack.\\n- [Shadow Priest Pack](https://wago.io/HkQsadDaf)\\n- [Standalone Tracker](https://wago.io/GSmlcVuus)\\n\\nYou can also use this aura to track how long your Voidform lasted:\\n- [VF Tracker by Kwokie#2870](https://wago.io/pCqdTXTAZ)\\n\\n## Rotation Goals Inside Voidform\\nSustaining Voidform isn\u2019t just about the new tier set, it\u2019s about execution. Here are some practical tips:\\n- **During Power Surge windows**: plan to fire four DPs relatively quickly so you earn the two extra Halos from the 4-pc. Don\u2019t greed other spells if you\u2019re about to miss that fourth DP.\\n- **Halo timing**: use Halo ASAP whenever possible; its echoes (plus any bonus Halos you trigger via 4-pc) are your Insanity engine for sustaining VF. (Power Surge\u2019s echo behavior is defined in the Archon kit; the set just adds more echoes when you spend correctly.)\\n- **Baseline priorities stay the same**: the core loop doesn\u2019t change, the set just rewards cleaner Insanity flow so your Voidforms last longer on average.\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nIf you are trying to practice the rotation, most Target Dummy setups will give you inaccurate results. This is because as soon as you damage a PvP dummy or heal a player that has hit a PvP dummy you will be flagged in PvP combat (particularly when pressing Halo). This will cause the set bonus to be nerfed significantly due to the PvP modifier attached to the spell.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### Low Gear Optimizations\\nIf you find yourself to have a low amount of gear, particularly Haste, you will find that executing this rotation to be quite challenging without lucky procs. If you find yourself in this situation you might opt to add more haste than usual as you are learning.\\n\\nAnother option is to add a larger cushion into the opener sequence between your initial cast of Halo and Void Eruption. This is simply just adding in two casts of Mind Blast after you press Halo and before you press Void Eruption, in any particular spot. This gives you another 2 GCD buffer to get that 2nd Halo cast off during Voidform. Strictly speaking this optimization should not be used when you have enough gear or when Bloodlust is active but can be useful as you are learning.\\n\\n## Simulation Data on Voidform Durations\\nTo ground expectations, here are Voidform duration statistics from a single target sim with Bloodlust on the opener:\\n\\n![](voidform.png)\\n\\n| Bloodlust on Opener | Duration | Percentage |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Yes | 65s or less | 5% |\\n| Yes | 70-80s | 8% |\\n| Yes | 80-90s | 42% |\\n| Yes | 90s+ | 45% |\\n\\nHere is that same setup without Bloodlust:\\n\\n![](nonbloodlust_voidform.png)\\n\\n| Bloodlust on Opener | Duration | Percentage |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| No | 65s or less | 35% |\\n| No | 70-80s | 10% |\\n| No | 80-90s | 25% |\\n| No | 90s+ | 30% |\\n\\n### What This Means in Practice\\n- **Sub-60s Voidforms are rare** \u2192 usually mechanics, downtime, or missed Devouring Plagues.  \\n- **80\u201390s Voidforms are the goal** \u2192 this is your realistic target.  \\n- **90s+ Voidforms happen** \u2192 but only with ideal uptime, procs, and movement-free fights.\\n\\nVoidforms should always last at least 60 seconds. With low haste or without Bloodlust you will have more cases of falling out right around that 60-65s range depending on mechanics, but these should be on the rarer side.\\n\\n| Duration Range | Goal | Notes |\\n|----------------|------|-------|\\n| **80\u201390s** | **Target Range** | Shows clean Halo + Devouring Plague execution inside Voidform. |\\n| **90s+** | **Excellent** | Ideal conditions: minimal movement, perfect Power Surge uptime, consistent Halo/DP cycles. |\\n| **Under 60s** | **Troubleshoot** | Check if you\'re: Missing DPs during Power Surge, Capping Insanity instead of spending, or Losing casts due to downtime or movement. |\\n\\n## Gear & Stat Targets for Sustained Voidforms\\nTo consistently land the 80\u201390s (or higher) Voidform windows, having the right balance of stats and item-level gear is just as important as rotation execution.\\n\\nBased on the [Stat Priority](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-stat-priority) Archon wants anywhere between 24% and 31% haste to execute things correctly. If you fall below this range in Haste you will likely struggle to consistently get longer Voidforms.\\n\\n## Video Examples\\n\\n### Bloodlust Opener Example\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/20U6J79jPyk?si=1Ti0EBO8QbSlhvic\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"},{"id":"season-3-shadow-priest-feedback","metadata":{"permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/season-3-shadow-priest-feedback","editUrl":"https://github.com/WarcraftPriests/bookofshadows/tree/main/blog/2025-06-29-ptr/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-29-ptr/index.md","title":"Season 3 Shadow Priest Feedback","description":"Shadow Priest Feedback","date":"2025-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ptr","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/tags/ptr"}],"readingTime":9.2,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Publik","title":"Maintainer of Book of Shadows","url":"https://github.com/seanpeters86","imageURL":"https://github.com/seanpeters86.png","key":"publik","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"season-3-shadow-priest-feedback","title":"Season 3 Shadow Priest Feedback","authors":["publik"],"tags":["ptr"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How Long Should Your Voidform Last in Season 3?","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/season-3-voidform-duration"},"nextItem":{"title":"Season 3 Set Bonus Feedback","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/season-3-set-bonus-feedback"}},"content":"## Shadow Priest Feedback\\n\\n### Major Cooldown Design\\nAll the way back in the [Dragonflight development cycle](https://www.bluetracker.gg/wow/topic/us-en/1279512-feedback-priests/) it was mentioned that our cooldowns would be looked at in a future patch. Several patches later the problems with Dark Ascension and Void Eruption as a choice node is still present in our spec tree.\\n\\nDark Ascension is incredibly simple in its design, and has little cohesion with our overall spec or talent tree design. This has recently become even worse with the removal of Mind Spike, which felt like it was the defacto filler to pick with Dark Ascension. In its current state I just do not understand why this is still in the game, I would much rather have a choice node that modifies Void Eruption instead of Dark Ascension (see below).\\n\\nBeing able to pick between a 1-minute Shadow Priest compared to a 2-minute Shadow Priest is a really cool concept. However, since these are separate cooldowns today there is a severe lack of cohesion with the rest of our kit since spells need to work with both. This also limits the design options you have with our cooldowns.\\n\\nAt this point Void Eruption is a much more interesting cooldown and I would prefer focusing Shadow Priests on that cooldown over Dark Ascension. Exploring past ideas like ramping DoT damage or haste as Voidform goes on would be cool to see in the modern game, but just is not possible as long as Dark Ascension still exists to balance Void Eruption against.\\n\\nNote that if Dark Ascension did go away it would mean a lot to the community to get a glyph that altered Voidform\'s animation to be the Dark Ascension wings. \\n\\n### DoT Maintenance and Application\\nThis patch we saw a few targeted changes at Shadow Crash to help with our DoT maintenance and application gameplay. Overall I think these changes solve good problems in raid, but seem to miss the mark for Mythic+ specifically.\\n\\n#### Shadow Crash Issues\\nThe two main pain points with the new design are as follows:\\n- Shadow Crash has become a damage talent with Descending Darkness\\n- Bugs limit its usefulness in Mythic+, particularly in large pulls\\n  - [Bug Report 1](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1093)\\n  - [Bug Report 2](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1286)\\n\\nShadow Crash has mostly existed as a DoT application tool, with an exception of a Dragonflight tier set that was quite controversial. The reason for the controversy is making it a damage button now gives us a conflict, do we press Shadow Crash for damage or hold for DoT\'ing targets? Luckily the 2 charge system can help with this, but largely this gameplay feels unhealthy to be pulling the player in two different ways. \\n\\nThere are quite a lot of people that dislike pressing Shadow Crash in single target, and it does feel quite weird, unsure if this was intentional. Due to current pathing challenges (see below) we take Shadow Crash and Descending Darkness in every single build currently. Part of this is pathing but also because it helps solve our issues with Mobility and Movement by giving us a valuable instant-cast to press when needed. Unfortunately this just feels like a conflicting design and I wish these problems could be solved with other solutions.\\n\\nThe other large issue is how these changes affect Mythic+. We have long known of [bugs](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20shadow%20crash) as it relates to Shadow Crash and DoT\'ing targets, particularly in large pulls. The changes lowering the target count seem to have made these bugs more prevalent/happen on more packs than usual. Until Shadow Crash correctly prioritizes un-dotted targets to apply DoTs vs. refreshing this spell will continue to be an incredibly flawed way of applying DoTs.\\n\\n#### Shadow Priest isn\'t a DoT Spec\\nI was pretty disappointed that there was nothing else adjusted with the spec as it relates to casting and maintaining DoT spells. We have been locked behind Misery being a required talent and Shadow Crash as our DoT applicator for quite some time now, and the issues are still quite obvious. There is no build variety that actually makes DoTs powerful vs. easy to spread, everything is just leaning in towards the easy to spread category. This makes our DoT gameplay non-existent in places where we used to actually press Vampiric Touch or Shadow Word: Pain in previous iterations, particularly low-target count environments.\\n\\nIn the current design since we take Shadow Crash everywhere we literally never press Shadow Word: Pain or Vampiric Touch in Single Target, and even most cleave environments. This has made Shadow Priests lose a core piece of its identity and I wish there were alternatives available in the tree to make DoTs an actual part of our gameplay again. This removes Shadow Word: Pain as a rotational instant-cast spell to use during movement.\\n\\nOn top of this our DoTs have continued to be neglected when it comes to power, currently only totalling to less than 4% of our total damage (SW:P and VT).\\n\\n### Utility Nodes in the Spec Tree\\nCurrently Shadow Priests have to choose 2 utility points in the top section of our talent tree before moving onto the middle section after picking all the damage nodes.\\n\\nThis creates a problem, as we are limited to 2 of the 4 of these nodes without losing DPS by sacrificing points in the rest of the tree.\\n- Dispersion\\n- Silence\\n- Intangibility or Mental Fortitude\\n- Last Word or Psychic Horror\\n\\nFor most content we always want to have Dispersion. This leaves effectively just one point left, which typically we players will choose Mental Fortitude to counter the squishy nature of playing a Priest. This means we are effectively choosing between losing defensive utility, our interrupt, or DPS with this choice.\\n\\nIf Dispersion and/or Silence were just made baseline for Shadow Priests this issue goes away.\\n\\n### Spec Tree Pathing Issues\\nWith the changes to the talent tree this patch I wanted to go over specific issues with pathing that we notice on the tree to bring up those pain points when creating a build.\\n- The Shadow Crash path is only 2 points to get to Void Torrent. The alternative option is 3 points which inherently puts these nodes at a disadvantage.\\n- The following nodes are in a weird spot where nothing before/after is related. They are also pretty uninspiring in general.\\n  - Madness Weaving\\n  - Dark Evangelism\\n  - Idol of Y\'Shaarj\\n- Number of 2 point nodes is still the highest in the game\\n- Plagued by lots of numerically weak nodes that do not change your gameplay or others that are super niche. These cause our pathing to be restricted.\\n\\nCore Shadow Priest Themes are not always easy to path or there are too few choices. I\'ve created annotated trees and then ranked their pathing situation for each core theme. Furthermore as a cost of these being core themes we notice that the actual base spells are severely undertuned. The cost of these spells having lots of talent points seems to be weak base spells, which impacts their dependency on these talents. Shadowy Apparitions, Mind Blast, Shadowfiend or Mindbender melees, and DoTs are extremely weak baseline.\\n- [Shadowy Apparitions](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/priest/shadow/archon/DBAAAGZFhfFQFQFQFQFAAAAA): **S**\\n- [Mind Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/priest/shadow/archon/DBAAAGg5BOBFBKBQBiUBBhOBAAAA): **B**\\n- [Pets](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/priest/shadow/archon/DBAAAFhXGh5GQGYGDGAAAAA): **D**\\n- [Mind Flay: Insanity](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/priest/shadow/archon/DBAAAFg9IQISIIIDIChOAfAAAAA): **D**\\n- [Shadow Word: Pain and Vampiric Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/priest/shadow/archon/DBAAAHhIDHCKJFJQJdJBDBhQBAAAA): **D**\\n\\n### Mobility, Movement, and Utility\\n\\n#### Mobility and Movement\\nShadow Priests have long been known for their mobility issues, which is still [very much relevant](https://www.twitch.tv/publikpriest/clip/OptimisticAmericanSalsifyGrammarKing-ifxkZMx8sCOrUrd3) in Season 3 of The War Within. \\n\\nThe only way Shadow Priests can actually counter this kind of mobility problem is to pay for a race change. Dractyhr, Goblin, and Void Elf become our only way to get meaningful movement displacement when other classes have this built into their kit. Nothing in the changes coming in Season 3 make this problem better. Vault of the Heavens or Door of Shadows in the Priest tree please?\\n\\n#### Utility\\nThe other topic that is still painful is our classes group utility. Often times the only thing that makes Priests stick out from the crowd is Power Word: Fortitude, something that Holy and Discipline also bring in addition to Shadow Priests. Giving Shadow some of its own identity when it comes to utility would go a long way.\\n\\nShadow Priests do get value out of Vampiric Embrace that Holy and Discipline do not, but this ability has its own flaws that often do not make it valuable. The two big ones are the \\"smart\\" heal aspect of Vampiric Embrace being pretty dumb and it being hard to press on-demand when the group actually needs healing. To get good healing out of this we need to be doing good damage, lining this up is typically not something Priests do in this day and age. Would rather the spell just be passive Leech for my party, or something that I can control more that is not tied to my damage as much.\\n\\nThe other big problem with Shadow Priests is how it relates in the current Mythic+ Group Composition meta. There are different requirements for what a healer or dps should bring to a group, and generally speaking our group utility for control is niche and typically weaker than our ranged dps counterparts.\\n- Shackle Undead usually has incredibly niche to no value every season in Mythic+\\n  - Why can\'t this work for more enemy types? Or just call it \\"Shackle\\"?\\n- Psychic Horror is a severe DPS loss to take (see above section on spec tree utility points)\\n- Silence is arguably the worst interrupt in the game for Mythic+ content. Often times the Silence portion of the effect is useless, leading to us just having a long cooldown interrupt.\\n- Dominate Mind is either overpowered or useless.\\n- Psychic Scream is pulling a lot of weight for us right now as an AoE stop, unfortunately we do have to play in melee to use it though. This was a big problem solved by Mind Bomb (particularly in its stun version) that I still miss to this day\\n- Mass Dispel has not only seen significant nerfs, there has also been a notable change in dungeon design limiting its use cases\\n- Void Tendrils goes most seasons with most players forgetting it even exists it is so niche and often useless\\n\\nPriests have had plenty of utility spells in the past that were useful, but not game breaking that have been taken away from us. Bringing some of these back or shoring up existing utility problems would go a long way to groups being excited about inviting a Shadow Priest into their group.\\n- Shining Force\\n- Mind Bomb"},{"id":"season-3-set-bonus-feedback","metadata":{"permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/season-3-set-bonus-feedback","editUrl":"https://github.com/WarcraftPriests/bookofshadows/tree/main/blog/2025-06-28-ptr/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-28-ptr/index.md","title":"Season 3 Set Bonus Feedback","description":"In the below sections I will go over the existing sets and feedback about them.

I have also included preliminary numbers on how strong these tier sets are currently.\\n\\n## Archon\\n- 2pc: `+4%`\\n- 2pc + 4pc: `+17%`\\n\\nThe Archon set bonus going into Season 3 is fairly straightforward, it gives us more Halos, which leads to more Insanity, and more Devouring Plague casts. This gives us even more casts of Mind Flay: Insanity and longer Voidforms.\\n\\nArchon was already a fairly uninspiring Hero talent setup for Shadow Priests, and this set really does not add to anything it was doing, just repeats more of the same. Unfortunately it has fallen into the age old trap of just making Voidform last longer and become more punishing. Adding in more Halo\'s could be interesting but not in the way that it currently does extending our Voidform, just getting the same visuals we have but for longer is not as exciting as the Voidweaver set. The 4-set also is in a weird spot that you do not actually get any value from this set until the burst part of your Voidform is over (18 seconds after you press Halo).\\n\\nA spec should not be able to sustain a single cast of its major cooldown for 90-120s. This effectively makes it not a cooldown considering how we get balanced around this. There are much more interesting ways to buff Voidform or our cooldowns that is not simply making them last longer. Voidform does not need to last longer.\\n\\nBeing able to sustain a single Voidform this long makes the gameplay more punishing when handling mechanics or having to move. This is just bringing back some of the old problems we had with drain-based Voidform in previous expansions without any of the cool parts of extending Voidform that we had (ramping haste/damage/insanity drain gameplay).\\n\\n## Voidweaver\\n- 2pc: `+20%`\\n- 2pc + 4pc: `+45%`\\n\\nClearly the Voidweaver set is currently overpowered. This needs to be resolved by nerfing this set specifically, and not base Shadow Priest nerfs. The set itself is fun to play with and feels like it changes our core gameplay loop during cooldowns for the better, but includes modifiers that simply bloat the value and are not necessary.\\n\\nThe reason that this set is so much fun to play with is it makes you feel like you are machine gunning out Void Blast casts, and it feels awesome. The cast time reduction and more important the cooldown reduction of Void Blast is what gives us this feeling, the damage modifier to Void Blast is not necessary and is just a massive tuning knob that does not need to be there. Similarly the 4pc buffing Entropic Rift damage is not necessary for the set to be powerful.\\n\\nA more appropriate version of the set that is not egregiously overtuned but still keep the parts that are fun might look like this:\\n- 2pc: Void Blast\'s cast time is reduced by 20%. Void Blast\'s cooldown is reduced by 50%.\\n- 4pc: Void Blast now also causes Entropic Rift to grow, and the damage of your next Void Torrent is increased by up to 100% based on the size of Entropic Rift when it collapses."},{"id":"11-2-ptr-rework","metadata":{"permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/11-2-ptr-rework","editUrl":"https://github.com/WarcraftPriests/bookofshadows/tree/main/blog/2025-06-18-ptr/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-18-ptr/index.md","title":"11.2 Shadow Priest Rework","description":"Below is my initial reaction to changes on the 11.2 PTR for Shadow Priests.","date":"2025-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ptr","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/tags/ptr"}],"readingTime":7.96,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Publik","title":"Maintainer of Book of Shadows","url":"https://github.com/seanpeters86","imageURL":"https://github.com/seanpeters86.png","key":"publik","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"11-2-ptr-rework","title":"11.2 Shadow Priest Rework","authors":["publik"],"tags":["ptr"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Season 3 Set Bonus Feedback","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/season-3-set-bonus-feedback"},"nextItem":{"title":"11.0.5.

The major gameplay changes you will notice are:\\n- [Mind Spike](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=73510/mind-spike) has been removed\\n- [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash) 15s CD 2 charges 6 targets baseline. [Whispering Shadows](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=406777/whispering-shadows) functionality merged into the base spell.\\n- [Void Volley](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1240401/void-volley) new active\\n- [Malediction](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373221/malediction) has been removed and is now baseline into [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent) making [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent) a 30 second cooldown.\\n- [Unfurling Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=341273/unfurling-darkness) has been removed.\\n- [Shadowy Apparitions](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=341491/shadowy-apparitions) can now critically strike independently of the spell that procced them.\\n- Base [Mind Flay](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=15407/mind-flay) damage and Insanity has been buffed and [Mind Flay: Insanity](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=391403/mind-flay-insanity) had its Insanity generation nerfed.\\n- [Deathspeaker](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=392507/deathspeaker) is now a fully passive talent instead of a proc.\\n\\n## Questions\\nBelow is the list of questions the community has with unclear interactions or changes coming in 11.2.\\n- Proc chance for [Tormented Spirits](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=391284/tormented-spirits) is unknown.\\n\\n## Problems Ignored\\nWhile the list of changes is overall pretty positive I was disappointed that a few of the issues the spec has went unaddressed this patch. Below are the big ones I feel still could use adjustments.\\n- Utility choice in top section\\n- Baseline [Shadowfiend](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=34433/shadowfiend)/[Mindbender](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=123040/mindbender) damage\\n- [Dark Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=391109/dark-ascension) vs. [Void Eruption](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=228260/void-eruption)\\n- Movement/displacement improvements\\n\\n## Pathing Issues\\nBelow is the list of current pathing issues I noticed with the talent tree redesign and where these nodes feel out of place in their current design and/or place on the tree in general. All of these options are also difficult to take/path into in their current state.\\n- [Dark Evangelism](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=391099/dark-evangelism) off of [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash).\\n- [Madness Weaving](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1240394/madness-weaving)\\n- [Idol of Y\'Shaarj](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=373310/idol-of-yshaarj)\\n\\n## Tier Set\\nOverall the sets seem pretty powerful numbers wise but still need to play-test them to see how they feel. First reaction is fairly positive!\\n\\n### Archon\\n- 2pc: [Halo](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=120644/halo)s generate an additional 10 Insanity over 5 sec and [Resonant Energy](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=453850/resonant-energy) additionally increases the damage of your [Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=335467/devouring-plague) by 5.0%.\\n- 4pc: While [Power Surge](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=453109/power-surge) is active, every 2 casts of [Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=335467/devouring-plague) adds another [Halo](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=120644/halo) to the effect at 100% effectiveness, up to 2 times.\\n\\n### Voidweaver\\nThis tier set will likely eliminate the need to pool [Mind Blasts](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=8092/mind-blast) before casting [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent).\\n\\n- 2pc: [Void Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=450405/void-blast) damage is increased by 40% and [Void Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=450405/void-blast)\'s cast time is reduced by 20%. [Void Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=450405/void-blast)\'s cooldown is reduced by 50%.\\n- 4pc: [Void Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=450405/void-blast) now also causes [Entropic Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=447444/entropic-rift) to grow, [Collapsing Void](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=448403/collapsing-void) increases [Entropic Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=447444/entropic-rift)\'s damage by an additional 20%, and the damage of your next [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent) is increased by up to 200% based on the size of [Entropic Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=447444/entropic-rift) when it collapses.\\n\\n## Talent Changes\\nIn this section I\'m going to quickly touch on the changes and give my reaction to them.\\n\\n- [Dark Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=391109/dark-ascension)\\n  - This talent still existing feels extra out of place now that [Mind Spike](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=73510/mind-spike) was removed since our only filler spell is now not buffed with this cooldown, particularly with [Surge of Insanity](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=391399/surge-of-insanity) procs.\\n- [Subservient Shadows](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1228516/subservient-shadows)\\n  - Most of the value comes from [Idol of C\'Thun](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=377349/idol-of-cthun)/[Idol of Yogg-Saron](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=373273/idol-of-yogg-saron) and not [Shadowfiend](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=34433/shadowfiend) or [Mindbender](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=123040/mindbender). With this current identity it feels a bit misplaced on the tree.\\n  - This talent does not work with [Depth of Shadows](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=451308/depth-of-shadows) (duration effect)\\n  - [Shadowfiend](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=34433/shadowfiend) and [Mindbender](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=123040/mindbender) being weak baseline is likely contributing to it feeling underwhelming in this current spot.\\n- [Madness Weaving](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1240394/madness-weaving)\\n  - Feels pretty lackluster given its place on the talent tree.\\n  - Weird way to add damage to the spec\\n  - The spec already likes mastery so its functionality feels misplaced and is not very clear to the average player.\\n- [Death\'s Torment](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1240364/deaths-torment)\\n  - Pathing feels like a good spot off of [Deathspeaker](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=392507/deathspeaker) and the echoes stacking [Idol of N\'Zoth](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=373280/idol-of-nzoth) feels like a good pathing interaction\\n- [Deathspeaker](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=392507/deathspeaker)\\n  - losing the movement global is a bit disappointing, wish we still had the proc version as a choice node\\n  - Really begins to highlight how weak Shadow Word: Death is baseline\\n  - While this talent on live does interact with [Depth of Shadows](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=451308/depth-of-shadows) this current iteration does not. Without adjusting that talent as well we have this weird zone between 35% and 20% health where we have different execute interactions which makes things feel confusing.\\n- [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash)\\n  - Cooldown/charges changes overall feel positive\\n  - With the removal of [Deathspeaker](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=392507/deathspeaker) as a movement global getting this as a pathing node into [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent) can be a decent alternative with [Descending Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1242666/descending-darkness). Unsure how it will feel weaving in [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash) on single target.\\n- [Descending Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1242666/descending-darkness)\\n  - while optimizing [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash) damage does give us yet another form of AoE you now have a conflicted sense of using it solely for DoT spreading or Damage. I personally liked not feeling pressured to use it on cooldown but rather being able to mostly just save it for DoTing purposes, and now this is a bit conflicting.\\n  - On fresh targets DoTs are applied after [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash) deals damage so you lose out on the Mastery modifier here which feels bad, another reason why making this a damage spell is awkward.\\n- [Void Volley](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1240401/void-volley)\\n  - not using its own keybind is awesome\\n  - this spell is just super cool and I love it\\n- [Idol of N\'Zoth](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=373280/idol-of-nzoth)\\n  - tooltip is very confusing\\n  - insanity generation buffs are currently hidden from your buff bar and combat log\\n  - [Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=335467/devouring-plague) gives 12 stacks regardless of [Mind\'s Eye](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=407470/minds-eye) vs. [Distorted Reality](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=409044/distorted-reality), potentially an oversight?\\n- [Idol of Y\'Shaarj](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=373310/idol-of-yshaarj)\\n  - This really has nothing to do with pets and does feels out of place on the tree for what it was reworked into.\\n  - The pathing talents are all pet related, and this talent proccing haste emphasizes a known issue with the game not updating pet melee-swing time in real-time after you get a haste proc. Pets update on a slower interval (roughly ~3 seconds) which makes this node feel even more out of place.\\n  - feels very feast or famine gameplay which is not typical of this spec."},{"id":"anniversary-patch","metadata":{"permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/anniversary-patch","editUrl":"https://github.com/WarcraftPriests/bookofshadows/tree/main/blog/2024-10-19=live/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-19=live/index.md","title":"11.0.5.

Below is the impactful updates, check out the [full notes here](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24145980/20th-anniversary-celebration-update-notes#item4).\\n\\n- [Sustained Potency](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=454001/sustained-potency) has been updated \u2013 It now also pauses the duration of [Dark Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109/dark-ascension) or [Voidform](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=194249/voidform) for up to 20 seconds while out of combat or affected by a loss of control effect. This is capped at 20 seconds per cast of each cooldown (i.e. going in and out of combat more than once does not refresh the pause duration).\\n- [Entropic Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447444/entropic-rift) now displays a low-noise version for your allies, instead of being completely invisible.\\n\\n### What this means\\nFunctionally nothing is really changing except Archon now can choose to take [Sustained Potency](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=454001/sustained-potency) even inside of Mythic+. The out of combat pause is very nice for dungeons, particularly in lower keys and it was already competitive to take anyways (particular for boss damage or really long pulls).\\n\\n### Dracthyr\\nStarting this patch you can also make a Dracthyr Priest. From a combat perspective you get a single Mastery point from [Awakened](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=365575/awakened), which you can see how that stacks up in [the charts](https://warcraftpriests.github.io/?talents=ar_vf_cthun_flay_me&sims=racials&fightStyle=Single). Other racials are listed below. To see these changes I did a [video](https://youtu.be/GILQKcE3Axs) when it first came out and a [revised one](https://youtu.be/iPoF8fkDbbU) after it was changed.\\n\\n- You can fight in Dracthyr form or Visage form as a Priest\\n- [Wing Buffet](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=357214/wing-buffet)\\n- [Tail Swipe](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=368970/tail-swipe) is EVOKER ONLY\\n- [Glide](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=358733/glide) (at a reduced speed compared to Evokers)\\n- [Soar](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=369536/soar)\\n- [Awakened](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=365575/awakened)\\n\\n## Anniversary Event\\nWith this patch there is also an upcoming launch of the Anniversary event. This event includes lots of cosmetics as well as some new gear drops that I will go over in this post as it relates to Shadow Priest. I am not covering all aspects of this event, only the ones relevant for player power. To see more about this checkout the [Wowhead guide](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/world-events/20th-anniversary-event).\\n\\n### Timewalking Dungeons?\\nCurrently there is a trinket, [Mindtap Talisman](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=18371/mindtap-talisman) that is from Dire Maul. This was available on the vendor on PTR but I am not sure specifically what the source of this could be. It is quite possible it is just a Timewalking dungeon drop during the event. If that is the case it would drop and be upgradable to 580 item level. I bring this up because even at 580 item level it is currently _extremely_ powerful. Beating out many trinkets at Myth track item level, although not being BiS.\\n\\n### Blackrock Depths Raid\\nThis [raid](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/world-events/20th-anniversary-event-blackrock-depths-raid-loot) is returning with **HERO** track gear. This is a great opportunity for alts as well as a few key drops that might even be useful for your main. Through a Relic Coffer Key system you can also purchase up to 3 items from a vendor if you clear the raid enough and do not see the drops you want.\\n\\n#### Notable Drops\\nThe following is listing ideal stat pieces that drop from the raid. There could be others that drop and are upgrades, here is just a short list to see what is available.\\n\\n| Item | Boss |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| [Burst of Knowledge](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=231424/burst-of-knowledge) | Ambassador Flamelash |\\n\\nThe [Burst of Knowledge](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=231424/burst-of-knowledge) is extremely powerful and is likely to get nerfed/adjusted at some point. Early sims put this equal or better to most trinkets at Myth track item level, even though Burst of Knowledge is only Hero track level. This means it is strictly speaking a purchasable item that is Best-In-Slot.\\n\\nCurrently this trinket is extra powerful since it is not on the shared trinket cooldown, meaning we can stack this in execute and use it with [Spymaster\'s Web](https://www.wowhead.com/item=220202/spymasters-web) as an example. I suspect this will be fixed, but even still this is a strong trinket that we simply just bind to [Power Infusion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=10060/power-infusion).\\n\\n- [Trinket Combo Sims](https://warcraftpriests.github.io/?talents=ar_vf_cthun_flay_me&sims=trinket_combos&fightStyle=Single)\\n- [Trinket Single Sims](https://warcraftpriests.github.io/?talents=ar_vf_cthun_flay_me&sims=trinkets&fightStyle=Single)\\n\\n#### Cantrip Items\\nIn addition to normal gear drops there are also Cantrip items with extra effects.

Shadow Priest Updates","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/anniversary-patch"},"nextItem":{"title":"Shadow Priest Iteration","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/shadow-priest-iteration"}},"content":"## DISCLAIMER\\nThis post is now _outdated_. We have posted updated guidance in IcyVeins and the Discord and the below information is mostly out of date. Keeping this only for historical purposes.\\n\\n## October 8th/9th Changes\\n\\nVoidweaver has received lots of buffs to its kit which when using the right talent build and optimized gear can end up being better than Archon in certain situations. When comparing the best builds Voidweaver is up to **1%** ahead of Archon, meaning they are very close.\\n\\n**THINGS ARE STILL BEING TESTED**\\n\\nIt takes us a long time to sim talent builds, especially with rotational changes. Having only gotten this on Friday night we are still working on things and the below information should be treated as **EARLY** information.\\n\\n## List of Changes\\n\\n- [Mind Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=8092/mind-blast) damage increased by 10%.\\n- [Shadow Word: Death](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=32379/shadow-word-death) damage increased by 10%.\\n- [Void Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205448/void-bolt) damage increased by 10%.\\n- [Shadowy Apparition](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341263/shadowy-apparition) damage increased by 10%.\\n- Voidweaver: [Entropic Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447444/entropic-rift) damage increased by 10%.\\n- Voidweaver: [Void Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450405/void-blast) damage increased by 20%.\\n- Voidweaver: [Collapsing Void](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=448403/collapsing-void) damage increased by 10%.\\n- Voidweaver: [Voidwraith](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=451234/voidwraith) damage increased by 10%.\\n- Voidweaver: [Inner Quietus](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=448278/inner-quietus) now increases [Vampiric Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=34914/vampiric-touch) and [Shadow Word: Pain](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=589/shadow-word-pain) damage by 25% (was 20%).\\n\\n### How big are these buffs?\\n\\n- Archon Single: +2.8%\\n- Voidweaver Single: +5.2%\\n- Archon Triple Idol AoE: +2.2%\\n- Archon Hybrid AoE: +2.2%\\n- Voidweaver AoE: +3.9%\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThere are a few keys things to note:\\n- [Unfurling Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341273/unfurling-darkness) is now strongly preferred for Voidweaver builds in non-dungeon environments. This supplements our DoT refreshing instead of relying on [Mental Decay](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375994/mental-decay) and also gives us an instant cast spell thats hits like a truck. This can still be used in dungeon environments depending on how much of your time is spent at lower target counts (5 or less).\\n- By default SimC will cause a certain percentage of ticks of [Entropic Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447444/entropic-rift) to miss, this is aimed at making it more realistic with boss and target movement. Chance is 5% on single target and up to 10% above 2 targets.\\n- Voidweaver will naturally struggle as you go into dungeons and start pulling massive packs together, anything more than 8 targets is rough. For this reason pushing keys will still prefer Archon most weeks, but any type of pug situation where you are pulling one pack a time will do great with Voidweaver, especially during [Voidbound](https://www.wowhead.com/affix=158/xalataths-bargain-voidbound) weeks.\\n\\n### When to pick Archon?\\n\\n- Consistent single target damage, not contingent on targets staying in place.\\n- Prefers the [Void Eruption](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=228260/void-eruption) playstyle\\n- Mythic+ Dungeons where you are pushing high key levels where packs are living 60+ seconds long or you are consistently pulling packs together and around your cooldowns.\\n\\n### When to pick Voidweaver?\\n\\n- Top single target damage, particularly when bosses are not moving out of [Entropic Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447444/entropic-rift). This is contingent on playing [Unfurling Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341273/unfurling-darkness). If you do not want to play with this talent than Archon will net more single target damage.\\n- Prefers the [Dark Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109/dark-ascension) playstyle\\n- Mythic+ Dungeons where you are pulling one pack at a time and not chain pulling massive pulls. Ideally stays at/under 8 targets as much as possible.\\n- Anytime you are fighting against absorb shields for [Devour Matter](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=451840/devour-matter) (i.e. [Voidbound](https://www.wowhead.com/affix=158/xalataths-bargain-voidbound) affix, Queen Ansurek intermission, etc)\\n\\n## Rotation Changes\\n\\nThe following is a list of changes done [to the APL](https://github.com/WarcraftPriests/tww-shadow-priest/commit/04ae29b302878e564879f8db1a060993b31e14de#diff-65271d6253b4d5d7711a953aab2f90f9ff8ad90db3ccbe0df8f7ac6a4fa91511) compared to before these changes. This is not a full list of how to play Voidweaver.\\n- Pool [Mind Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=8092/mind-blast) for 1 GCD with [Mind Flay](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407/mind-flay) or 2 GCDs with [Mind Spike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510/mind-spike) before [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=263165/void-torrent) comes off cooldown with Voidweaver\\n- As Voidweaver you should cast [Vampiric Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=34914/vampiric-touch) to proc [Unfurling Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341273/unfurling-darkness) when facing less than 6 targets and [Dark Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109/dark-ascension) is not active. This falls just above normal [Mind Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=8092/mind-blast) in the priority list.\\n- You should cast [Vampiric Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=34914/vampiric-touch) to spend [Unfurling Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341273/unfurling-darkness) as a top priority action when the buff is available. This means as soon as you proc this you immediately spend it.\\n- Removed unlocked [Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=335467/devouring-plague) use during [Dark Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109/dark-ascension) and instead unlocked it while [Entropic Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447444/entropic-rift) is active specifically. You still use [Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=335467/devouring-plague) at high priority if it is about to expire or you are capping on Insanity.\\n\\n### Example Voidweaver Opener\\n\\nThis is an example opener with the `VW_VE_VW_DA_cthun_82852967308207_Spike_DR` build.\\n1. Cast [Halo](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=120644/halo) pre-pull for 10 Insanity\\n2. Open with [Vampiric Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=34914/vampiric-touch) to proc [Unfurling Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341273/unfurling-darkness) and apply our DoTs\\n3. Cast [Vampiric Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=34914/vampiric-touch) again to consume [Unfurling Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341273/unfurling-darkness)\\n4. [Mind Spike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510/mind-spike)\\n5. [Voidwraith](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=451234/voidwraith)\\n6. [Dark Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109/dark-ascension)\\n7. [Power Infusion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=10060/power-infusion) + [Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212265/tempered-potion)\\n8. [Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=335467/devouring-plague)\\n9. [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=263165/void-torrent)\\n10. [Void Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450405/void-blast)\\n11. [Void Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450405/void-blast)\\n12. [Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=335467/devouring-plague)\\n\\nFull openers with a wider variety of talent builds will be posted to the guide soon.\\n\\n## WeakAuras\\n\\nWith all of the changes there are a few WeakAuras to list to help with the rotational parts of playing Voidweaver Shadow Priest.\\n- [Pooling Mind Blast Helper](https://wago.io/KyDoZneJU)\\n- [Unfurling Darkness](https://wago.io/VZNUnVvO0)\\n- These are all baked into [Publik\'s WeakAura Set](https://wago.io/HkQsadDaf)\\n\\n## Breakdowns\\n\\nThe below charts include breakdowns in the various sim environments. Click each link to see the builds used. Note that this page will not be updated after the launch of the changes and you should check the [guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-spec-builds-talents) for the most up to

these topics already but wanted to call out a few things that are still plaguing the spec.\\n\\n# Bugs\\nThere are a lot of bugs facing the spec currently, several of which are very impactful to playing the game. The full list is [here](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/labels/Priest) with the big ones below:\\n- [Halo is pulling mobs that are not currently in combat](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1217)\\n- [Voidheart is expiring early](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1216)\\n- [Voidwraith pet is taking full damage as if it was a player](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1210)\\n- [Darkening Horizon is not always extending correctly](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1201)\\n- [Mind Soothe is not castable](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1197)\\n- [Idol of C\'Thun is completely broken](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1218)\\n\\n# Season 1 Tier Set Bonus\\nCurrently the tier set for Shadow Priests is about a 3% DPS gain going from equivalent gear without the set bonus to equipping the full 4 set. This is particularly due to the strength of Distorted Reality (especially early on with less stats) and the inherent synergy with Mind\'s Eye. Mind\'s Eye does gain about 5% with the set but this is not enough to offset the loss at current tuning.\\n\\nIn AoE situations the set bonus is about 4%, primarily due to preferring Mind\'s Eye for these builds. Overall this makes for a pretty underwhelming set bonus effect power wise, and particularly stings because the set bonus is pretty boring as it stands today.\\n\\n# Hero Talent Iteration\\nSo far we have not seen much iteration on our Hero Talent trees, particularly for Archon. Archon looks exactly how it did when it was first released and not a single thing was ever changed or iterated on, including the actual numerical tuning of the tree. I don\'t want to repost feedback but this is extremely disappointing and it feels like this just wasn\'t a priority to work on.\\n\\nWhile Voidweaver did get some iteration early on there are still quite a few challenges that tree has that would really help to see more iteration and changes with to make it feel better to play, particularly with the way the Entropic Rift spawns and follows targets.\\n\\n# Talent Tree Tree Iteration\\nGoing into the expansion Shadow Priest has received little to no changes to the base spec. While we have gotten reworks quite often over the years none of these have really ever felt complete and this certainly adds to the frustration when comments made in previous dev cycles of revisiting things like Dark Ascension were never changed in the TWW beta cycle.\\n\\nFurthermore Shadow Priests now have the most 2 point nodes in our tree, and our class tree has the most total points. This equates to 1894837640784 possible builds of our class tree which is obviously an insane number to reason about, but is kind of crazy considering some classes only have  a fraction of a percent of that amount. This is not solely indicative of a problem, but does make Priests feel like our tree is not created equally when looking at other classes and specs in the game.\\n\\nThis is still causing ugly issues in places like the Shadow spec tree where you have to pick between more DPS or taking the loss to get crucial defensive or utility nodes. As far as I\'m aware the design goals were to not have this be a choice but we still have a crowded top section of our talent tree which feels horrible."},{"id":"beta-state","metadata":{"permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/beta-state","editUrl":"https://github.com/WarcraftPriests/bookofshadows/tree/main/blog/2024-06-30-beta/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-30-beta/index.md","title":"State of Voidweaver and Archon","description":"Decided to wrap up some previous posts and feedback into a more concise entry to give current good, bad, and bugs for Voidweaver and Archon from a Shadow Priest perspective.","date":"2024-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"beta","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/tags/beta"},{"inline":true,"label":"voidweaver","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/tags/voidweaver"},{"inline":true,"label":"archon","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/tags/archon"}],"readingTime":1.46,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Publik","title":"Maintainer of Book of Shadows","url":"https://github.com/seanpeters86","imageURL":"https://github.com/seanpeters86.png","key":"publik","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"beta-state","title":"State of Voidweaver and Archon","authors":["publik"],"tags":["beta","voidweaver","archon"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Shadow Priest Iteration","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/shadow-priest-iteration"},"nextItem":{"title":"Shadow Priest Bug Roundup","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/bug-roundup"}},"content":"Decided to wrap up some previous posts and feedback into a more concise entry to give current good, bad, and bugs for Voidweaver and Archon from a Shadow Priest perspective.\\n\\n# State of Voidweaver\\n## Good\\n- Visually exciting\\n- Mini-bursts every 30s feel nice\\n- Cast while moving Void Torrent is fun to play with\\n\\n## Bad\\n- Shadowy Insight procs can be frustrating as we pool Mind Blasts before our Void Torrent and waste these procs.\\n- Travel time to getting to the target can be frustrating, would feel much better if it just spawned under the target.\\n- Pooling Mind Blasts before Void Torrents can be awkward\\n- Slowly follows the target if its moving across the room too fast\\n- Feels like we need to play around Mind Melt a bit too much\\n- Lack of Void interactions on the tree, particularly Voidform.

Because of a change made to make Shadowy Insight no longer grant a temporary charge of Mind Blast, these procs can often be completely wasted. We are incentivized to bank of Mind Blasts right before Void Torrents but these procs happening right before can end up being very frustrating.\\n\\nThe other thing that is still a bit weird is the emphasis around Shadow Word: Death and Shadowfiend spells. Neither of these are particularly related to the Void but do end up in several places on the tree: Devour Matter, Depth of Shadows, and Voidwraith. Personally I do not see how these fit together in the build and end up making our points in the spec tree feel even more restrictive. Devour Matter is definitely the odd one out here, it is a pretty boring node that I often forget even exists.\\n\\nThe last big thing with Voidweaver that does not feel very satisfying is the size of the Rift and the expansion. Because of how little we end up casting Devouring Plague rotationally this expansion is very minor, especially compared to Discipline. Making this work with ticks of Devouring Plague or adjusting how much it grows per cast would go a long way to making this be more usable. With the current size of the rift and positioning of a pack in Mythic+ it could be awkwardly missing a lot of mobs. This is also notably worse off because the Rift does not currently retarget if the original target dies.\\n\\n## Archon\\nCompared to Voidweaver, Archon is particularly uninspiring to play with. The playstyle is basically the baseline version of the spec we have in Dragonflight, you just now press Halo at the start of your cooldowns. It is possible this was the goal all along for Archon, but having a relatively small change to the spec for a whole Hero talent feel wise does not make it feel like a Hero Talent to me. \\n\\nThis is made even worse with the lack of distinct visual changes with Archon. Yes we spawn a few extra Halos and it radiates out and back to us, but for a spec themed around empowering our cooldowns this just misses the mark for me when our cooldowns are lacking any visual change. Even the Hero Talent icon itself looks amazing but feels really out of place considering the visuals and feel of the spec do not match.\\n\\nArchon itself is likely suffering from an already existing problem the spec has with cooldowns that are not particularly exciting by themselves (particularly Dark Ascension).\\n\\nThe one thing that Archon has going for it that might even make us feel pulled to play it is the absolutely disgusting amount of off-healing we get from being centered around Halo. Not sure how this will be balanced but that is a strong positive.\\n\\n## General Shadow Priest\\n\\nWhile I already covered recent changes [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/feedback-priests/1870412/91) I wanted to discuss a few other points that I would love to see discussion or changes towards.\\n\\nWe have not seen any spec tree changes so I do not want to copy things from my [previous post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/shadow-priest-dragonflight-feedback/1819255) but these issues are generally all still present and would welcome any changes here to help improve our spec tree.\\n\\n### Shadow Crash and Void Crash\\nAdding in Void Crash as an alternative to Shadow Crash will be a welcomed change for some players, but also creates some anti-patterns with the current size of the spell. Because of the relatively small radius of Shadow and Void Crash (8 yards), having it be centered around a single enemy can easily make it difficult to target a full clump of adds. This can also be quite confusing for new players using the talent. Increasing this up to 10 or 12 yards (likely alongside Shadow Crash) would make it feel much better from a DoT management perspective.\\n\\n## Notable Bugs\\n- Mind Soothe is currently not able to be cast at all.

Overall these changes create more problems than they end up solving in the first place and my inclination is to revert back to previous iterations. More details below, starting from the top of the changes.\\n\\n## Collapsing Void\\n> as well as to make Collapsing Void more relevant for encounters with lower health enemies\\n\\nOverall this is actually a positive change, the length of the Rift was certainly opening the spec up to challenges in shorter lived content so it being balanced around smaller windows makes a lot of sense depending on tuning.\\n\\n## Devour Matter and Void Empowerment\\n> In addition, Devour Matter felt like an odd choice against Void Empowerment, so now it is a node that you are guaranteed to have.\\n\\nIn regards to Devour Matter I\'m still unsure how exactly the Shadow Word: Death nodes fit with the Voidweaver theme, but point wise the choice node does make more sense to move it. Devour Matter itself still feels out of place on the tree. \\n\\nFor the new choice node the duration extension now is effectively a choice against Collapsing Void size expansion and damage, which feels like a weird choice depending on where tuning comes into the picture. If the goal is to have shorter lived windows I don\'t think extending by only 3 seconds is really enough to notice much of an impact considering Void Blast has such a long cooldown.\\n\\nOverall I think Darkening Horizon makes less sense in this version of Voidweaver, a small amount of extension just isn\'t enough to feel powerful and feels weak in comparison to Void Empowerment, especially if we are going to have smaller rifts more of them with this design.\\n\\n## Entropic Rift\\n> Entropic Rift duration reduced to 8 seconds (was 10 seconds).\\nThis change by itself seems okay along with the goal posted above, however it does have some knock on effects with other changes (see below). In addition this also means Shadow has an even harder time empowering the rift and expanding its size since we can only do this with Devouring Plague casts. More than ever it desperately needs to also work with Devouring Plague ticks in order to feel rewarding.\\n\\n> Entropic Rift is now summoned by Shadow Crash instead of Void Torrent.\\nWith Shadow Crash being a 20 second cooldown and the Rift only lasting 8 seconds baseline you will now be strongly incentivize to only cast Mind Blast during Rift windows, this can create gameplay that makes Voidweaver much less intuitive. Overall this feels more awkward than it did with being attached to Void Torrent. Having the Rift reset the cooldown of Mind Blast could solve this, but would likely be way too strong and I\'m not sure of another way around this that feels healthy.\\n\\nThe spec in general doesn\'t feel right locking into Shadow Crash everywhere, especially single target. Void Torrent feels good to press almost everywhere so it did not have this problem. Reducing the ramp time of the Entropic Rift (don\'t have to wait for Void Torrent channel) is slightly improved, but the change from last week felt like a great solve to this in my opinion and I\'m sad to see this change from Void Torrent and I personally preferred the older version instead of the Shadow Crash one.\\n\\nThis also creates a lot of problems with damage pattern inside of Mythic+ environments, similar to what was observed during Season 3 of Dragonflight where we pressed Shadow Crash for damage. Adding damage to Shadow Crash makes it really frustrating to play with as its our DoT application spell. If we are trying to get prepped for a pull and DoTing enemies Shadow Crash is now a full-blown damage spell (way more than it was in Season 3). This is also even more frustrating mid-way through a pull when you are faced with a choice of pressing Shadow Crash for damage on this pack vs. holding it for the next one to get your damage going. The spell doesn\'t create rewarding gameplay when its used for both DoT application and damage.\\n\\nThis change is basically opening up the can of worms of problems with [Shadow Crash](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/shadow-priest-dragonflight-feedback/1819255#unsatisfying-dot-management-options-6) and personally I think its less fun than when the rift was attached to Void Torrent because of all of this.\\n\\n> Inner Quietus has been redesigned \u2013 Shadow Crash deals 400% additional damage to its primary target (was Vampiric Touch and Shadow Word: Pain damage increased by 20%).\\n\\nThis is similar to the points above, adding damage to Shadow Crash just doesn\'t feel good since we use it for DoT application today and not for damage reasons.\\n\\n## Shadow Crash\\n> Shadow Crash now centers on your target, rather than using a reticle to target a position on the ground.\\n\\nThis change overall is extremely polarizing. While this does make the spell easier to target in some cases, it also makes it significantly less useful in other cases. Often times we are able to pre-cast Shadow Crash to time it with mobs spawning (i.e. Sarkareth or 2nd boss Brackenhide), but this is no longer possible with this change. The travel time on the spell also now requiring a target is just solving the problem of it being difficult to target while creating a new problem of being less useful in certain situations. \\n\\nInstead of making this change I would personally rather have the old version. If this new functionality is the direction the spec is going in I would strongly like to have a similar choice node in our spec tree to what Windwalker Monks have with Skytouch and Skyreach. Give us the ability to choose a cast-on-target Shadow Crash or a ground-target Shadow Crash so that we don\'t lose our existing functionality but gain the accessability advantages.\\n\\n## Tree Cohesion\\nAfter these changes the tree feels more directionless and we have a lot of nodes working with unrelated abilities. While the Entropic Rift was changed to Shadow Crash, we still have a node that makes Void Torrent cast while moving, which is still a cool node but now feels way more random unless we revert that change. Personally would love for this to be more focused to make building around Voidweaver feel more distinct. Shadow Word: Death and Mindbender nodes in particular still feel out of place, equally so with Void Torrent/Shadow Crash conflicting.\\n\\nPoint Categorization:\\n- Void Torrent - 1\\n- Shadow Crash - 2\\n- Mind Blast - 4\\n- Devouring Plague- 2\\n- Shadow Word: Death - 2\\n- Shadowfiend/Mindbender - 2"},{"id":"alpha-feedback-archon","metadata":{"permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/alpha-feedback-archon","editUrl":"https://github.com/WarcraftPriests/bookofshadows/tree/main/blog/2024-05-02-alpha/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-02-alpha/index.md","title":"Alpha Feedback - Archon","description":"The following feedback is from the perspective of a Shadow Priest.","date":"2024-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"alpha","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/tags/alpha"},{"inline":true,"label":"archon","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/tags/archon"}],"readingTime":5.2,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Publik","title":"Maintainer of Book of Shadows","url":"https://github.com/seanpeters86","imageURL":"https://github.com/seanpeters86.png","key":"publik","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"alpha-feedback-archon","title":"Alpha Feedback - Archon","authors":["publik"],"tags":["alpha","archon"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Shadow Crash Incident - Voidweaver","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/shadow-crash-incident"},"nextItem":{"title":"Alpha Feedback - Voidweaver","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/alpha-feedback-voidweaver"}},"content":"The following feedback is from the perspective of a Shadow Priest.\\n\\nOverall Archon starts to deliver on the fantasy of enhanced cooldowns, but does it in a way with Halo that does not quite fit together nicely as a Shadow Priest. The empowered cooldowns themselves also do not feel particularly different than normally, they just now last a bit longer and you press Halo beforehand. That being said the iteration we see now does look powerful, although I wish it had more than just an updated Halo visual to enhance the theme, particularly with our cooldowns or Surge of Insanity casts. The Halo visual change itself also feels a bit lackluster for Shadow in particular and not sure I prefer it over the current version.\\n\\nSurge of Insanity casts and Shadowy Apparitions don\'t feel super connected to the tree, but could be a big point to develop a visually different experience as an Archon. \\n\\nThe description for Archon says, \\"Archons can be blessed from higher beings to enter into an ascended state, becoming an ultimate version of themselves\\". The current version of the tree doesn\'t have enough changing with our cooldowns to actually make them feel like ultimate versions, both visually and playstyle wise. There are plenty of buffs to the cooldowns themselves but other than that it doesn\'t hit the theme well enough for me, especially compared to Voidweaver. Dark Ascension and Void Eruption are both a bit lacking in terms of identity, this could be a good time to revisiting [this feedback](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/shadow-priest-dragonflight-feedback/1819255#cooldown-identity-crisis-7).\\n\\nAll current bugs for Priests in The War Within are listed [here](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%222-The+War+Within%22+label%3APriest).\\n\\n## Hero Talents that you feel are \u201crequired\u201d for your spec in a type of content, such as raiding or Mythic+, or that push you towards picking a specific tree.\\n- Word of Supremacy for Archon would make you feel pushed toward the tree when trying to live high-key Mythic+ dungeons compared to Voidweaver\\n\\n## Any bugs blocking testing?\\n- [Animation of Halo does not seem to match when the damage happens](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1190), but the Holy version seems to match.\\n- [As an Archon Priest, if someone else casts Power Infusion on you while yours is active, it will remove your existing Power Infusion buff completely.](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1191)\\n- [If you are mid-cast of Mind Spike and get a proc of Mind Spike: Insanity from a Halo creation it will consume the Surge of Insanity and not give you the increased damage](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1192). It should either buff the damage or not consume the proc (which is what Mind Flay: Insanity does). This also does not generate a Shadowy Apparition from this bug.\\n\\n## Hero Talents that Create Frustrating or Unsatisfying gameplay\\n- Current iteration of Sustained Potency means that you can gain damage using a 2-minute \\"opener\\". Since the hidden buff does not reset on combat start with a boss (mostly looking at raid here, should not reset on dungeon bosses) you can use a 2 minute opener to cast two Halo\'s pre-pull to bank 6 seconds and then cast the third Halo during cooldowns to get 9s of extension on your opener cooldown. This is pretty degenerate and probably shouldn\'t be a mechanic.\\n- Halo being a casted spell adds to the bloat of the opener and feels unsatisfying. We have Shadowfiend or Mindbender + Casted Halo + Casted Dark Ascension/Void Eruption to start our cooldowns.\\n- Since Archon interacts with Surge of Insanity, it brings up issues with Mind Flay: Insanity and Mind Spike: Insanity [that we brought up earlier](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/shadow-priest-dragonflight-feedback/1819255#filler-spell-insanity-9).\\n  - Mind Spike: Insanity feels the same as Mind Spike and not visually different. Compared to Surge of Light being instant-cast these feel much worse.\\n  - Mind Flay: Insanity feels unsatisfying to press and longer to execute. Impossible to weave many of these into your burst window.\\n  - Makes Voidform builds, particularly with Mind\'s Eye feel very cluttered with having extra Surge of Insanity procs during cooldowns, especially with Mind Flay: Insanity. You are even sometimes encouraged to instantly cancel Mind Flay: Insanity just to not waste the Shadowy Apparition.\\n  - Giving mobility to these spells would help make Archon not only feel different to play, but also add movement into a tree that currently does not have anything\\n- The cooldown extension makes Ancient Madness feel less satisfying as it still fizzles out quickly and is still much less valuable with Void Eruption.\\n- Currently we use Divine Star to get Insanity pre-pull to start out with 25 when the pull starts. This makes the opener feel much better and because of the way Halo works with the Insanity decay and the fact that we now want it for damage this doesn\'t become an option anymore since the tree does not work with Divine Star.\\n\\n## Hero Talents where Functionality is Confusing, Unclear, or Difficult to Track\\n- Halo\'s range currently is increased to 40 yards, but in reality its closer to 37 or so. Standing exactly 40 yards away from the target you will not get any hits of Halo. This same problem exists today on live/without Archon but at 27 yards instead of 30.\\n- Heightened Alteration working for Dispersion doesn\'t feel like its giving us much. More duration is not something that is very useful. Not really sure what this was intended to give the spec.\\n- Sustained Potency stacks outside of your cooldown (buff should not be hidden)\\n- Dark Ascension Perfected Form modifier is applying twice to Direct spell damage, and not to any periodic.\\n- Void Eruption Perfected Form is an additive effect instead of multiplicative with the existing modifier, this is confusing and slightly low-balling the damage increase\\n- Resonant Energy debuff stacking is confusing since the damage taken increase does not stack, just the slow\\n- The extra Halo\'s generated from Power Surge not giving Insanity is unclear if that is intended\\n- Power Surge has no buff to track when the future Halo\'s are happening"},{"id":"alpha-feedback-voidweaver","metadata":{"permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/alpha-feedback-voidweaver","editUrl":"https://github.com/WarcraftPriests/bookofshadows/tree/main/blog/2024-04-18-alpha/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-18-alpha/index.md","title":"Alpha Feedback - Voidweaver","description":"The following feedback is from the perspective of a Shadow Priest.","date":"2024-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"alpha","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/tags/alpha"},{"inline":true,"label":"voidweaver","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/tags/voidweaver"}],"readingTime":9.9,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Publik","title":"Maintainer of Book of Shadows","url":"https://github.com/seanpeters86","imageURL":"https://github.com/seanpeters86.png","key":"publik","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"alpha-feedback-voidweaver","title":"Alpha Feedback - Voidweaver","authors":["publik"],"tags":["alpha","voidweaver"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Alpha Feedback - Archon","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/alpha-feedback-archon"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/welcome"}},"content":"The following feedback is from the perspective of a Shadow Priest.\\n\\nYou can find all current bugs for Priests in The War Within [here](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%222-The+War+Within%22+label%3APriest).\\n\\n## Any bugs blocking testing?\\n- Voidwraith\\n  - [Does not work with Mindbender](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1174) (see below section)\\n  - [Does not trigger Idol of Y\'Shaarj](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1175)\\n  - [Sometimes melee\'s instead of casting](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1179)\\n  - [Is not scaling with any of our Priest modifiers](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1180).

This is directly linked to feeling like we cannot quite \\"cap\\" the rift size or extension consistently. If that was fixed this might also be better to play with. There is some charm in having to chase the rotation here.\\n  - Currently Shadow also feels like it has to ramp to get meaningful damage out of the talent, the Void Torrent channel into then spawning the rift and then reaching peak 15 seconds later is a very long time in environments when things do not live that long. \\n- Darkening Horizon feels very unachievable to get the full extension without Bloodlust, Power Infusion, and a lot of baseline haste while also getting lucky with procs. Not being able to max this except in rare cases is unsatisfying.\\n  - Reducing the cooldown of Void Blast, making it Instant Cast, working with other spells as well, and/or increasing how much extension you get per Void Blast would help\\n  - Changing it to a spammable spell like Discipline probably would not feel fun, as it would really hurt the value of non-filler spells during this window\\n- Collapsing Void Devouring Plague expansion feels extremely underwhelming or even non-existent, even after casting 5 Devouring Plagues the size of the rift is still smaller than 8 yards, which is less than Shadow Crash and by then it fizzles away.\\n  - Make it work with Devouring Plague ticks and/or significantly increase how much it is increased by per cast\\n  - Fantasy element and visually this is extremely underwhelming\\n- When a mob dies that was the original target of Entropic Rift, this can feel super unsatisfying, especially if it remains as a small size since it currently does not move or re-target.\\n  - Would be awesome if an enemy dies in the rift it also expands and \\"consumes\\" them \\n- Entropic Rift not pulling enemies in feels unsatisfying. For a spell that closely resembles a black hole, I wish it acted more like it. The slow from No Escape is in a similar space but not nearly what I expected. In PvE the applications for the slow are quite underwhelming.\\n- The choice node between No Escape and Dark Energy is unsatisfying. At the current size of the rift No Escape feels extremely underwhelming and likely will not have many use cases in PvE at the current size Shadow can get it to. In the current state it feels like Dark Energy will be preferred always.\\n  -  Would love to see additions or changes to No Escape such as the black hole design mentioned above.\\n  -  Adjusting the pacing/sizing that Shadow can get the rift to would certainly help No Escape.\\n- The choice node between Devour Matter and Void Empowerment does not feel satisfying. Devour Matter is an extremely niche ability in almost all types of content, where it will only provide a small amount of value even if the condition is met. On the other hand Void Empowerment is always useful and consistent and provides value every 30 seconds with Malediction.\\n  - If we had this choice node on live, in current examples where we do face enemies with shields (Tindral, Fyrakk, Iridikron) that is such a small portion of the fight, Void Empowerment would still be the better choice.\\n- Currently locks you into the bottom right side of our spec talent tree for this spec as Void Torrent, Malediction, and Idol of C\'Thun all have such strong synergies. Could be frustrating when taking any Shadow Word: Death points in Voidweaver that also encourage spending points in the bottom left side of our spec tree.\\n- In certain cases Shadow might be incentivized to cancel Void Torrent early just to get the rift to spawn sooner. This might just come down to tuning of Void Torrent though. Spawning at the start of the cast would have even more problems depending on tuning of Void Torrent, end is better but that incentive is still there. This is also contributing to having a somewhat length burst/ramp time for our damage. Will take 3 seconds of Void Torrent + up to 15 seconds of the Rift before it collapses, which is a long time for damage especially in environments like Normal dungeons.\\n\\n## Hero Talents where Functionality is Confusing, Unclear, or Difficult to Track\\n- Cooldown of Voidwraith is confusing since when taking Mindbender the cooldown is not lowered at all and remains fixed at 2 minutes, making Mindbender a completely dead talent.\\n- Depth of Shadows (`451308`) has an internal cooldown of 1 second. This can be confusing for players because at higher haste levels and a Death and Madness reset you can cast Shadow Word: Death back to back and the second cast would be unable to proc the effect.\\n- Proc rate of Depth of Shadows and the health threshold is currently unknown and not shown on the spell.\\n- Inner Quietus [does not increase the direct damage of Shadow Word: Pain](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1177). This is particular is confusing with Catharsis.\\n- Voidwraith\'s talent tooltip indicates that it deals \\"up to 50% additional damage, dealing more damage to higher health enemies\\" but the actual spell deals a flat 135% of spellpower and then if the mob is above 50% health it deals 100% increased damage. This is inconsistent with the talent tooltip and not sure what is intended.\\n- There is nothing baseline in-game to track how many times you have extended Entropic Rift (and if you have any left) with Darkening Horizon without using some kind of WeakAura. (x/5)\\n- There is nothing baseline in-game to track how many times you have expanded Entropic Rift with Collapsing Void without using some kind of WeakAura. (x/8)\\n- [Void Blast\'s tooltip shows a low number for Shadow](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1185)\\n- Visual of Entropic Rift can be hard to see in certain environments on the ground, and because it does not re-target after the original dies this is important to know where to drag mobs into, especially for your Tank in PvE environments. The rift not re-targeting after the original dies is also unintuitive.\\n\\n# Entropic Rift Windows\\n[quote=\\"Publik-thrall, post:2, topic:1833178\\"]\\nCurrent Entropic Rift window feels very busy and borderline overwhelming and you are rushing to try and get Void Blasts and Devouring Plagues out and do not have room to do much else. This is directly linked to feeling like we cannot quite \u201ccap\u201d the rift size or extension consistently. If that was fixed this might also be better to play with. There is some charm in having to chase the rotation here.\\n[/quote]\\n\\nAfter spending a bit more time with Voidweaver I wanted to clarify this comment a bit since I was pretty vague in this statement.\\n\\nThe Entropic Rift window specifically for Shadow Priests has a varying degree of pure gameplay feel based on other talents that we are picking. Particularly if you are playing a build with Void Eruption and especially worse if you also have Inescapable Torment. With Void Eruption you inevitably have to sacrifice some casts of spells like Void Bolt to prioritize Entropic Rift casts in a way that makes it feel busy. \\n\\nThere\'s enough rotational pressure from Void Blasts, Devouring Plague (and Shadow Word: Death if you have Inescapable Torment) to make the windows feel rewarding that adding the additional rotational pressure of Void Bolt detracts from the experience and makes it feel significantly less rewarding. \\n\\nFor a Hero Talent tree that has Void in the name Void Eruption does not have great synergies with these spells. Void Eruption as a cooldown is primarily focused around Void Bolt, which doesn\'t have any direct synergies with Voidweaver. We only rarely will reach maximum extension of the rift duration from very lucky procs, and by doing so we are de-prioritizing Void Bolts.\\n\\nFor other builds that do not use Void Eruption the Rift itself brings a much welcomed pacing into the build that feels like you are working towards something. That something is still a bit uninspiring at the current size of the rift, but that was covered in a different section. Expanding the rift size in general feels lackluster as a Shadow Priest (much better as Discipline).\\n\\nI think there should be some kind of sweet spot the build lives where expanding the rifts size should feel exciting and rewarding, and the extension of the rift duration should be easy to get a few casts, and reward players that are more skillful with the full extension. For Shadow Priests the rift expansion is extremely underwhelming and it feels like we can almost never get the full duration extension off, even while playing perfectly.\\n\\n# Opener Concerns and Setup Time\\nAnother point I didn\'t get to focus on earlier was the opener itself into the Entropic Rift. As a goal we are encouraged to have our DoTs active before pressing Void Torrent, but with how we start off pulls currently we are heavily incentivized to just cast Void Torrent for one tick and then cancel to spawn the rift just to get into the start of our opener. Casting Void Torrent just into Vampiric Touch and Shadow Word: Pain on the opener just isn\'t worth full channeling, and sitting there building up to 45/50/55 Insanity for Devouring Plague (depending on talents) is quite a long wait for our cooldown cycle.\\n\\nThis is certainly part of tuning overall, but is something we are noticing with the opener and setup of a Voidweaver Shadow Priest that is a bit awkward to play with currently.\\n\\n# Pathing and Build Diversity\\nThe other big thing related to this is how the tree is currently pressuring you to not only pickup Void Torrent, Malediction, and Idol of C\'Thun in the bottom section, but talents like Depth of Shadows or Voidwraith also pull you towards Mindbender, Inescapable Torment, and Idol of Y\'Shaarj (assuming bugs are worked out/intended to work with these). Mastermind is also an extremely valuable point with any build due to the strength of Void Blast. \\n\\nEncouraging and locking into the bottom right section is totally expected with the core of Entropic Rift, but it just gets a bit much when we are also heavily encouraged to path on the complete opposite side of the tree, not to mention thematically the Shadow Word: Death and Pet-focused spells don\'t exactly fit the Void theme as well as other nodes."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/WarcraftPriests/bookofshadows/tree/main/blog/2024-01-12-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-12-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to Book of Shadows!","date":"2024-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"news","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/tags/news"}],"readingTime":0.03,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Publik","title":"Maintainer of Book of Shadows","url":"https://github.com/seanpeters86","imageURL":"https://github.com/seanpeters86.png","key":"publik","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","authors":["publik"],"tags":["news"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Alpha Feedback - Voidweaver","permalink":"/bookofshadows/blog/alpha-feedback-voidweaver"}},"content":"Welcome to Book of Shadows!"}]}}')}}]);
