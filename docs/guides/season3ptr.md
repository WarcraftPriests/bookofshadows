# Season 3 PTR Information
This guide is a temporary one-stop-shop for all current PTR info for testing Shadow Priest. This is all preliminary info, subject to change often. We encourage trying things out during testing as much as possible but feel free to use this as starting points.

This page will be updated throughout the PTR cycle and will be taken down once the patch goes live in favor of the normal guide sites.

Reminder to please post your thoughts and feedback on playing Shadow Priest on [the forums](<https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/shadow-priest-feedback/2120140>). Be respectful.

## Talents
With the change to [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash) it is now quite a stable talent for all builds, so we do not have as much build variety across raid encounters or even Mythic+. For now these seem to be the best starting points for each Hero Talent. 

**TUNING IS NOT FINAL**: Most things are still very much a work-in-progress.

### Voidweaver
Core talents for Voidweaver are pretty static across fight types, with minor changes you can make. The multi-target build is particularly designed for the new 3 target council raid encounter.

- [Single Target](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/priest/shadow/voidweaver/DAREEAVFEERUFEKFSJFQCBUOVFFUVQRZRASAlRCRUEFVVUCVA)
  - `CIQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMDMzDAAAAAAAAAAAAYM2GMzMLbbMzYmZmZZwsxMzMjZjBGjhZxsN1MDWgZmBACwsNbLBzGbA2mB`
  - You can drop [Phantasmal Pathogen](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=407469/phantasmal-pathogen) for [Voidtouched](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=407430/voidtouched), this is about a `0.3%` loss but can make it easier to play
- [Single Target + Execute](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/priest/shadow/voidweaver/DAREEAVFEERUFEKFSJFQCBUOVFFUVQRZQQSAlRCRUEFVVUCUA)
  - `CIQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMDmZeAAAAAAAAAAAAAjxGMzMLbbMzYmZmZZwsxMzMjZjBGjhZxsN1MDWgZmBACwsNbLBzGLA2mB`
  - Gives you another movement global between 35 and 20%
  - This drops [Voidwraith](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=451234/voidwraith) and [Mindbender](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=200174/mindbender) for [Depth of Shadows](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=451308/depth-of-shadows) and [Deathspeaker](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=392507/deathspeaker). This is roughly a `0.2%` loss in overall with a slight gain in execute.
- [AoE](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/priest/shadow/voidweaver/DAREEAVFEERUFEKFSJFQCBUOVFFUVURZAQSAlRCRUEFVVUCUA)
  - `CIQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMDmZAAAAAAAAAAAAYM2gZmZZbbMzYmZmZZwsxMzMjZjBGjhZxsN1MDWgZmBACwsNbLBzGLA2mB`
  - particularly designed for 3 target council raid encounter or Mythic+
  - If you want to pickup [Silence](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=15487/silence) you would drop [Dark Thoughts](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1240388/dark-thoughts)

### Archon
Archon is just using a single build for the moment.

- [Triple Idol](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/priest/shadow/archon/DAREEAVFEERUFEKFSJFQCBUOVFFUVQRZRBSBEVCUQEFVVUBR)
  - `CIQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMeAAAAAAAAAAAAAjxygZmZbZjZmZmZmZZwsxMzMjZjBGjhZxsN1MDWwMAzsZZ0sZAIjxCAsNDA`
  - We use this for everything. You can choose to swap out [Mindbender](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=200174/mindbender) for [Deathspeaker](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=392507/deathspeaker) if you want a bit more execute damage.
  - If you prefer to play with [Voidtouched](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=407430/voidtouched) you can drop [Phantasmal Pathogen](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=407469/phantasmal-pathogen) for a `1.1%` loss
  - For dungeons if you want to pickup [Silence](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=15487/silence) you would drop [Phantasmal Pathogen](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=407469/phantasmal-pathogen)

## Rotation
This season will be identical to the rotation of previous seasons, just with the loss of a few spells/procs that we did not always take.

Additions to the rotation:
- [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash): used to mainly refresh DoTs. Can use above a normal [Mind Flay](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=15407/mind-flay) filler action if you are capped on charges with [Descending Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1242666/descending-darkness). Great global to use for movement similar to how we used Unfurling Darkness (assuming you have [Descending Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1242666/descending-darkness)).
- [Void Volley](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1240401/void-volley): Do not rush to press this, you have plenty of time and [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent) is cooling down as soon as you cast [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent). Ideally this is a movement global when needed. If you do not have [Void Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=450405/void-blast) or [Mind Flay: Insanity](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=391403/mind-flay-insanity) to use you can send it.

### Opener

#### Voidweaver
Pre-Cast [Halo](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=120644/halo) before combat to get 10 Insanity.

1. Open with [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash) if it will hit, otherwise [Vampiric Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=34914/vampiric-touch)

8. [Void Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=450405/void-blast) x2

#### Archon
This patch with the relative tuning to [Mind Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=8092/mind-blast) and other spells we opt to adjust the opener.

1. Open with [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash) if it will hit, otherwise [Vampiric Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=34914/vampiric-touch)
2. [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent)

7. [Void Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205448/void-bolt)

## Gear

### Tier Set Pieces
Ideally we use Head, Chest, Gloves, and Legs [tier](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item-set=1927/eulogy-to-a-dying-star).

### Trinkets
Starting with these but we don't have sims yet.

- [Araz's Ritual Forge](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242402/arazs-ritual-forge)
- [Astral Antenna](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242395/astral-antenna)
- [Essence-Hunter Eyeglass](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=246939/essence-hunters-eyeglass)

# Macros
You can use this macro to prevent double hitting [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent) cancelling itself with [Void Volley](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1240401/void-volley).

```
