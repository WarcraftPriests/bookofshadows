# Season 3 PTR Information
This guide is a temporary one-stop-shop for all current PTR info for testing Shadow Priest. This is all preliminary info, subject to change often. We encourage trying things out during testing as much as possible but feel free to use this as starting points.

This page will be updated throughout the PTR cycle and will be taken down once the patch goes live in favor of the normal guide sites.

Reminder to please post your thoughts and feedback on playing Shadow Priest on [the forums](<https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/shadow-priest-feedback/2120140>). Be respectful.

## Talents
With the change to [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash) it is now quite a stable talent for all builds, so we do not have as much build variety across raid encounters or even Mythic+. For now these seem to be the best starting points for each Hero Talent. 

**TUNING IS NOT FINAL**: Most things are still very much a work-in-progress.

### Voidweaver
Core talents for Voidweaver are pretty static across fight types, with minor changes you can make.

- [Single Target](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/priest/shadow/voidweaver/DAREEAVFEERUFEKFSJFQCBUOVFFUVQRZRASAlRCRUEFVVUCVA)
  - `CIQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMDMzDAAAAAAAAAAAAYM2GMzMLbbMzYmZmZZwsxMzMjZjBGjhZxsN1MDWgZmBACwsNbLBzGbA2mB`
- [Single Target + Execute](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/priest/shadow/voidweaver/DAREEAVFEERUFEKFSJFQCBUOVFFUVQRZQQSAlRCRUEFVVUCUA)
  - `CIQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMDmZeAAAAAAAAAAAAAjxGMzMLbbMzYmZmZZwsxMzMjZjBGjhZxsN1MDWgZmBACwsNbLBzGLA2mB`
  - Gives you another movement global between 35 and 20%
  - This is about 0.5% loss compared to base, but gives you about 2% more execute and better for adds/multi-target setups
- [AoE/Mythic+](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/priest/shadow/voidweaver/DAREEAVFEERUFEKFSJFQCBUOVVFUVQRZAQSAlRCRUEFVVUCUA)
  - `CIQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMDmZAAAAAAAAAAAAYM2YMzMLbbMzYmZmZZwsxMzMjZjBGjhZxsN1MDWgZmBACwsNbLBzGLA2mB`
  - If you do not need Silence and Mental Fort you can instead take Maddening Touch (4+) or Dark Thoughts (1-3T)

### Archon
- [Single Target](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/priest/shadow/archon/DAREEAVFEERUFEKFSJFQCBUOVFFUUQUFpBSBEVCUAEFVVUBR)
  - `CIQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMGAAAAAAAAAAAAjHYWGMzMbLbMzMzMzMLDmNmZmZMbMwYMMLmtpmZwCmBYmNLjmNDAZMWAAYA`
- [Single Target + Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/priest/shadow/archon/DAREEAVFEERUFEKFSJFQCBUOVFFUVQQZhBSBEVCUQEFVVUBR)
  - `CIQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMGAAAAAAAAAAAAjxygZmZbZjZmZmZmZZwsxMzMjZjBGjhZxsN1MDWwMAzsZZ0sZAIjxCAsNA`
  - This is roughly 0.3% worse in pure single target, better anytime there are adds
- [AoE/Mythic+](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/priest/shadow/archon/DAREEAVFEERUFEKFSJFQCBUOVVFUVQRZARSBEVCUQEFVVUBR)
  - `CIQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMmBAAAAAAAAAAAAjxCjZmZbZjZmZmZmZZwsxMzMjZjBGjhZxsN1MDWwMAzsZZ0sZAIjxCAsNDA`
  - If you do not need Silence and Mental Fort you can instead take Phantom Menace (4+) or Phantasmal Pathogen (1-3T)

## Rotation
This season will be identical to the rotation of previous seasons, just with the loss of a few spells/procs that we did not always take.

Additions to the rotation:
- [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash): used to mainly refresh DoTs. Can use above a normal [Mind Flay](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=15407/mind-flay) filler action if you are capped on charges with [Descending Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1242666/descending-darkness). Great global to use for movement similar to how we used Unfurling Darkness (assuming you have [Descending Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1242666/descending-darkness)).
- [Void Volley](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1240401/void-volley): Do not rush to press this, you have plenty of time and [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent) is cooling down as soon as you cast [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent). Ideally this is a movement global when needed. If you do not have [Void Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=450405/void-blast) or [Mind Flay: Insanity](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=391403/mind-flay-insanity) to use you can send it.

### Opener

#### Voidweaver
Pre-Cast [Halo](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=120644/halo) before combat to get 10 Insanity.

1. Open with [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash) if it will hit, otherwise [Vampiric Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=34914/vampiric-touch)

5. [Power Infusion](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=10060/power-infusion) + [Tempered Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=212265/tempered-potion) + On Use Trinket

#### Archon
This patch with the relative tuning to [Mind Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=8092/mind-blast) and other spells we opt to adjust the opener.

1. Open with [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash) if it will hit, otherwise [Vampiric Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=34914/vampiric-touch)
2. [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent)
3. [Halo](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=120644/halo)
4. [Shadowfiend](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=34433/shadowfiend) or [Mindbender](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=200174/mindbender)
5. Void Eruption
6. [Power Infusion](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=10060/power-infusion) + [Tempered Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=212265/tempered-potion) + On Use Trinket
7. [Void Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205448/void-bolt)

## Gear

### D.I.S.C Belt
Drop this when you get a normal belt around 710-714 item level

### Stats
We are still fine-tuning but early looks at stats appear to follow these priorities:
- Voidweaver: Mastery >> Haste > Crit > Vers (Only wants ~20% haste)
- Archon: Mastery > Haste > Crit > Vers (Only wants ~30% haste)

### Tier Set Pieces
Ideally we use Head, Chest, Gloves, and Legs from our [tier](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item-set=1927/eulogy-to-a-dying-star) set.

### Trinkets
Early sims are [here](https://warcraftpriests.github.io/?talents=vw_da_cthun&sims=trinkets&fightStyle=Single&version=ptr)

### Consumables
- Weapon Enchant: [Stonebound Artistry](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=223765/enchant-weapon-stonebound-artistry) or [Oathsworn's Tenacity](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=223768/enchant-weapon-oathsworns-tenacity)

# Macros
You can use this macro to prevent double hitting [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent) cancelling itself with [Void Volley](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1240401/void-volley).

```
