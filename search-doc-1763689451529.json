Since the hidden buff does not reset on combat start with a boss (mostly looking at raid here, should not reset on dungeon bosses) you can use a 2 minute opener to cast two Halo's pre-pull to bank 6 seconds and then cast the third Halo during cooldowns to get 9s of extension on your opener cooldown. This is pretty degenerate and probably shouldn't be a mechanic.Halo being a casted spell adds to the bloat of the opener and feels unsatisfying. We have Shadowfiend or Mindbender + Casted Halo + Casted Dark Ascension/Void Eruption to start our cooldowns.Since Archon interacts with Surge of Insanity, it brings up issues with Mind Flay: Insanity and Mind Spike: Insanity that we brought up earlier. Mind Spike: Insanity feels the same as Mind Spike and not visually different. Compared to Surge of Light being instant-cast these feel much worse.Mind Flay: Insanity feels unsatisfying to press and longer to execute. Impossible to weave many of these into your burst window.Makes Voidform builds, particularly with Mind's Eye feel very cluttered with having extra Surge of Insanity procs during cooldowns, especially with Mind Flay: Insanity. You are even sometimes encouraged to instantly cancel Mind Flay: Insanity just to not waste the Shadowy Apparition.Giving mobility to these spells would help make Archon not only feel different to play, but also add movement into a tree that currently does not have anything The cooldown extension makes Ancient Madness feel less satisfying as it still fizzles out quickly and is still much less valuable with Void Eruption.Currently we use Divine Star to get Insanity pre-pull to start out with 25 when the pull starts. This makes the opener feel much better and because of the way Halo works with the Insanity decay and the fact that we now want it for damage this doesn't become an option anymore since the tree does not work with Divine Star.

This is directly linked to feeling like we cannot quite &quot;cap&quot; the rift size or extension consistently. If that was fixed this might also be better to play with. There is some charm in having to chase the rotation here. Currently Shadow also feels like it has to ramp to get meaningful damage out of the talent, the Void Torrent channel into then spawning the rift and then reaching peak 15 seconds later is a very long time in environments when things do not live that long. Darkening Horizon feels very unachievable to get the full extension without Bloodlust, Power Infusion, and a lot of baseline haste while also getting lucky with procs. Not being able to max this except in rare cases is unsatisfying. Reducing the cooldown of Void Blast, making it Instant Cast, working with other spells as well, and/or increasing how much extension you get per Void Blast would helpChanging it to a spammable spell like Discipline probably would not feel fun, as it would really hurt the value of non-filler spells during this window Collapsing Void Devouring Plague expansion feels extremely underwhelming or even non-existent, even after casting 5 Devouring Plagues the size of the rift is still smaller than 8 yards, which is less than Shadow Crash and by then it fizzles away. Make it work with Devouring Plague ticks and/or significantly increase how much it is increased by per castFantasy element and visually this is extremely underwhelming When a mob dies that was the original target of Entropic Rift, this can feel super unsatisfying, especially if it remains as a small size since it currently does not move or re-target. Would be awesome if an enemy dies in the rift it also expands and &quot;consumes&quot; them Entropic Rift not pulling enemies in feels unsatisfying. For a spell that closely resembles a black hole, I wish it acted more like it. The slow from No Escape is in a similar space but not nearly what I expected. In PvE the applications for the slow are quite underwhelming.The choice node between No Escape and Dark Energy is unsatisfying. At the current size of the rift No Escape feels extremely underwhelming and likely will not have many use cases in PvE at the current size Shadow can get it to. In the current state it feels like Dark Energy will be preferred always. Would love to see additions or changes to No Escape such as the black hole design mentioned above.Adjusting the pacing/sizing that Shadow can get the rift to would certainly help No Escape. The choice node between Devour Matter and Void Empowerment does not feel satisfying. Devour Matter is an extremely niche ability in almost all types of content, where it will only provide a small amount of value even if the condition is met. On the other hand Void Empowerment is always useful and consistent and provides value every 30 seconds with Malediction. If we had this choice node on live, in current examples where we do face enemies with shields (Tindral, Fyrakk, Iridikron) that is such a small portion of the fight, Void Empowerment would still be the better choice. Currently locks you into the bottom right side of our spec talent tree for this spec as Void Torrent, Malediction, and Idol of C'Thun all have such strong synergies. Could be frustrating when taking any Shadow Word: Death points in Voidweaver that also encourage spending points in the bottom left side of our spec tree.In certain cases Shadow might be incentivized to cancel Void Torrent early just to get the rift to spawn sooner. This might just come down to tuning of Void Torrent though. Spawning at the start of the cast would have even more problems depending on tuning of Void Torrent, end is better but that incentive is still there. This is also contributing to having a somewhat length burst/ramp time for our damage. Will take 3 seconds of Void Torrent + up to 15 seconds of the Rift before it collapses, which is a long time for damage especially in environments like Normal dungeons.

Entropic Rift Windows  [quote=&quot;Publik-thrall, post:2, topic:1833178&quot;] Current Entropic Rift window feels very busy and borderline overwhelming and you are rushing to try and get Void Blasts and Devouring Plagues out and do not have room to do much else. This is directly linked to feeling like we cannot quite “cap” the rift size or extension consistently. If that was fixed this might also be better to play with. There is some charm in having to chase the rotation here. [/quote]  After spending a bit more time with Voidweaver I wanted to clarify this comment a bit since I was pretty vague in this statement.  The Entropic Rift window specifically for Shadow Priests has a varying degree of pure gameplay feel based on other talents that we are picking. Particularly if you are playing a build with Void Eruption and especially worse if you also have Inescapable Torment. With Void Eruption you inevitably have to sacrifice some casts of spells like Void Bolt to prioritize Entropic Rift casts in a way that makes it feel busy.  There's enough rotational pressure from Void Blasts, Devouring Plague (and Shadow Word: Death if you have Inescapable Torment) to make the windows feel rewarding that adding the additional rotational pressure of Void Bolt detracts from the experience and makes it feel significantly less rewarding.  For a Hero Talent tree that has Void in the name Void Eruption does not have great synergies with these spells. Void Eruption as a cooldown is primarily focused around Void Bolt, which doesn't have any direct synergies with Voidweaver. We only rarely will reach maximum extension of the rift duration from very lucky procs, and by doing so we are de-prioritizing Void Bolts.  For other builds that do not use Void Eruption the Rift itself brings a much welcomed pacing into the build that feels like you are working towards something. That something is still a bit uninspiring at the current size of the rift, but that was covered in a different section. Expanding the rift size in general feels lackluster as a Shadow Priest (much better as Discipline).  I think there should be some kind of sweet spot the build lives where expanding the rifts size should feel exciting and rewarding, and the extension of the rift duration should be easy to get a few casts, and reward players that are more skillful with the full extension. For Shadow Priests the rift expansion is extremely underwhelming and it feels like we can almost never get the full duration extension off, even while playing perfectly.  Opener Concerns and Setup Time  Another point I didn't get to focus on earlier was the opener itself into the Entropic Rift. As a goal we are encouraged to have our DoTs active before pressing Void Torrent, but with how we start off pulls currently we are heavily incentivized to just cast Void Torrent for one tick and then cancel to spawn the rift just to get into the start of our opener. Casting Void Torrent just into Vampiric Touch and Shadow Word: Pain on the opener just isn't worth full channeling, and sitting there building up to 45/50/55 Insanity for Devouring Plague (depending on talents) is quite a long wait for our cooldown cycle.  This is certainly part of tuning overall, but is something we are noticing with the opener and setup of a Voidweaver Shadow Priest that is a bit awkward to play with currently.  Pathing and Build Diversity  The other big thing related to this is how the tree is currently pressuring you to not only pickup Void Torrent, Malediction, and Idol of C'Thun in the bottom section, but talents like Depth of Shadows or Voidwraith also pull you towards Mindbender, Inescapable Torment, and Idol of Y'Shaarj (assuming bugs are worked out/intended to work with these). Mastermind is also an extremely valuable point with any build due to the strength of Void Blast.  Encouraging and locking into the bottom right section is totally expected with the core of Entropic Rift, but it just gets a bit much when we are also heavily encouraged to path on the complete opposite side of the tree, not to mention thematically the Shadow Word: Death and Pet-focused spells don't exactly fit the Void theme as well as other nodes.

Madness Weaving Feels pretty lackluster given its place on the talent tree.Weird way to add damage to the specThe spec already likes mastery so its functionality feels misplaced and is not very clear to the average player. Death's Torment Pathing feels like a good spot off of Deathspeaker and the echoes stacking Idol of N'Zoth feels like a good pathing interaction Deathspeaker losing the movement global is a bit disappointing, wish we still had the proc version as a choice nodeReally begins to highlight how weak Shadow Word: Death is baselineWhile this talent on live does interact with Depth of Shadows this current iteration does not. Without adjusting that talent as well we have this weird zone between 35% and 20% health where we have different execute interactions which makes things feel confusing. Shadow Crash Cooldown/charges changes overall feel positiveWith the removal of Deathspeaker as a movement global getting this as a pathing node into Void Torrent can be a decent alternative with Descending Darkness. Unsure how it will feel weaving in Shadow Crash on single target. Descending Darkness while optimizing Shadow Crash damage does give us yet another form of AoE you now have a conflicted sense of using it solely for DoT spreading or Damage. I personally liked not feeling pressured to use it on cooldown but rather being able to mostly just save it for DoTing purposes, and now this is a bit conflicting.On fresh targets DoTs are applied after Shadow Crash deals damage so you lose out on the Mastery modifier here which feels bad, another reason why making this a damage spell is awkward. Void Volley not using its own keybind is awesomethis spell is just super cool and I love it Idol of N'Zoth tooltip is very confusinginsanity generation buffs are currently hidden from your buff bar and combat logDevouring Plague gives 12 stacks regardless of Mind's Eye vs. Distorted Reality, potentially an oversight?

One of the most frustrating moments right now when playing Voidweaver is getting Shadowy Insight procs while banking up for your next Entropic Rift. Because of a change made to make Shadowy Insight no longer grant a temporary charge of Mind Blast, these procs can often be completely wasted. We are incentivized to bank of Mind Blasts right before Void Torrents but these procs happening right before can end up being very frustrating.  The other thing that is still a bit weird is the emphasis around Shadow Word: Death and Shadowfiend spells. Neither of these are particularly related to the Void but do end up in several places on the tree: Devour Matter, Depth of Shadows, and Voidwraith. Personally I do not see how these fit together in the build and end up making our points in the spec tree feel even more restrictive. Devour Matter is definitely the odd one out here, it is a pretty boring node that I often forget even exists.  The last big thing with Voidweaver that does not feel very satisfying is the size of the Rift and the expansion. Because of how little we end up casting Devouring Plague rotationally this expansion is very minor, especially compared to Discipline. Making this work with ticks of Devouring Plague or adjusting how much it grows per cast would go a long way to making this be more usable. With the current size of the rift and positioning of a pack in Mythic+ it could be awkwardly missing a lot of mobs. This is also notably worse off because the Rift does not currently retarget if the original target dies.

This is made even worse with the lack of distinct visual changes with Archon. Yes we spawn a few extra Halos and it radiates out and back to us, but for a spec themed around empowering our cooldowns this just misses the mark for me when our cooldowns are lacking any visual change. Even the Hero Talent icon itself looks amazing but feels really out of place considering the visuals and feel of the spec do not match.  Archon itself is likely suffering from an already existing problem the spec has with cooldowns that are not particularly exciting by themselves (particularly Dark Ascension).  The one thing that Archon has going for it that might even make us feel pulled to play it is the absolutely disgusting amount of off-healing we get from being centered around Halo. Not sure how this will be balanced but that is a strong positive.

This gives us even more casts of Mind Flay: Insanity and longer Voidforms.  Archon was already a fairly uninspiring Hero talent setup for Shadow Priests, and this set really does not add to anything it was doing, just repeats more of the same. Unfortunately it has fallen into the age old trap of just making Voidform last longer and become more punishing. Adding in more Halo's could be interesting but not in the way that it currently does extending our Voidform, just getting the same visuals we have but for longer is not as exciting as the Voidweaver set. The 4-set also is in a weird spot that you do not actually get any value from this set until the burst part of your Voidform is over (18 seconds after you press Halo).  A spec should not be able to sustain a single cast of its major cooldown for 90-120s. This effectively makes it not a cooldown considering how we get balanced around this. There are much more interesting ways to buff Voidform or our cooldowns that is not simply making them last longer. Voidform does not need to last longer.  Being able to sustain a single Voidform this long makes the gameplay more punishing when handling mechanics or having to move. This is just bringing back some of the old problems we had with drain-based Voidform in previous expansions without any of the cool parts of extending Voidform that we had (ramping haste/damage/insanity drain gameplay).

The set itself is fun to play with and feels like it changes our core gameplay loop during cooldowns for the better, but includes modifiers that simply bloat the value and are not necessary.  The reason that this set is so much fun to play with is it makes you feel like you are machine gunning out Void Blast casts, and it feels awesome. The cast time reduction and more important the cooldown reduction of Void Blast is what gives us this feeling, the damage modifier to Void Blast is not necessary and is just a massive tuning knob that does not need to be there. Similarly the 4pc buffing Entropic Rift damage is not necessary for the set to be powerful.  A more appropriate version of the set that is not egregiously overtuned but still keep the parts that are fun might look like this:  2pc: Void Blast's cast time is reduced by 20%. Void Blast's cooldown is reduced by 50%.4pc: Void Blast now also causes Entropic Rift to grow, and the damage of your next Void Torrent is increased by up to 100% based on the size of Entropic Rift when it collapses.

Several patches later the problems with Dark Ascension and Void Eruption as a choice node is still present in our spec tree.  Dark Ascension is incredibly simple in its design, and has little cohesion with our overall spec or talent tree design. This has recently become even worse with the removal of Mind Spike, which felt like it was the defacto filler to pick with Dark Ascension. In its current state I just do not understand why this is still in the game, I would much rather have a choice node that modifies Void Eruption instead of Dark Ascension (see below).  Being able to pick between a 1-minute Shadow Priest compared to a 2-minute Shadow Priest is a really cool concept. However, since these are separate cooldowns today there is a severe lack of cohesion with the rest of our kit since spells need to work with both. This also limits the design options you have with our cooldowns.  At this point Void Eruption is a much more interesting cooldown and I would prefer focusing Shadow Priests on that cooldown over Dark Ascension. Exploring past ideas like ramping DoT damage or haste as Voidform goes on would be cool to see in the modern game, but just is not possible as long as Dark Ascension still exists to balance Void Eruption against.  Note that if Dark Ascension did go away it would mean a lot to the community to get a glyph that altered Voidform's animation to be the Dark Ascension wings.

Shadow Crash Issues​  The two main pain points with the new design are as follows:  Shadow Crash has become a damage talent with Descending DarknessBugs limit its usefulness in Mythic+, particularly in large pulls Bug Report 1Bug Report 2  Shadow Crash has mostly existed as a DoT application tool, with an exception of a Dragonflight tier set that was quite controversial. The reason for the controversy is making it a damage button now gives us a conflict, do we press Shadow Crash for damage or hold for DoT'ing targets? Luckily the 2 charge system can help with this, but largely this gameplay feels unhealthy to be pulling the player in two different ways.  There are quite a lot of people that dislike pressing Shadow Crash in single target, and it does feel quite weird, unsure if this was intentional. Due to current pathing challenges (see below) we take Shadow Crash and Descending Darkness in every single build currently. Part of this is pathing but also because it helps solve our issues with Mobility and Movement by giving us a valuable instant-cast to press when needed. Unfortunately this just feels like a conflicting design and I wish these problems could be solved with other solutions.  The other large issue is how these changes affect Mythic+. We have long known of bugs as it relates to Shadow Crash and DoT'ing targets, particularly in large pulls. The changes lowering the target count seem to have made these bugs more prevalent/happen on more packs than usual. Until Shadow Crash correctly prioritizes un-dotted targets to apply DoTs vs. refreshing this spell will continue to be an incredibly flawed way of applying DoTs.  Shadow Priest isn't a DoT Spec​  I was pretty disappointed that there was nothing else adjusted with the spec as it relates to casting and maintaining DoT spells. We have been locked behind Misery being a required talent and Shadow Crash as our DoT applicator for quite some time now, and the issues are still quite obvious. There is no build variety that actually makes DoTs powerful vs. easy to spread, everything is just leaning in towards the easy to spread category. This makes our DoT gameplay non-existent in places where we used to actually press Vampiric Touch or Shadow Word: Pain in previous iterations, particularly low-target count environments.  In the current design since we take Shadow Crash everywhere we literally never press Shadow Word: Pain or Vampiric Touch in Single Target, and even most cleave environments. This has made Shadow Priests lose a core piece of its identity and I wish there were alternatives available in the tree to make DoTs an actual part of our gameplay again. This removes Shadow Word: Pain as a rotational instant-cast spell to use during movement.  On top of this our DoTs have continued to be neglected when it comes to power, currently only totalling to less than 4% of our total damage (SW:P and VT).

This creates a problem, as we are limited to 2 of the 4 of these nodes without losing DPS by sacrificing points in the rest of the tree.  DispersionSilenceIntangibility or Mental FortitudeLast Word or Psychic Horror  For most content we always want to have Dispersion. This leaves effectively just one point left, which typically we players will choose Mental Fortitude to counter the squishy nature of playing a Priest. This means we are effectively choosing between losing defensive utility, our interrupt, or DPS with this choice.  If Dispersion and/or Silence were just made baseline for Shadow Priests this issue goes away.

The Shadow Crash path is only 2 points to get to Void Torrent. The alternative option is 3 points which inherently puts these nodes at a disadvantage.The following nodes are in a weird spot where nothing before/after is related. They are also pretty uninspiring in general. Madness WeavingDark EvangelismIdol of Y'Shaarj Number of 2 point nodes is still the highest in the gamePlagued by lots of numerically weak nodes that do not change your gameplay or others that are super niche. These cause our pathing to be restricted.  Core Shadow Priest Themes are not always easy to path or there are too few choices. I've created annotated trees and then ranked their pathing situation for each core theme. Furthermore as a cost of these being core themes we notice that the actual base spells are severely undertuned. The cost of these spells having lots of talent points seems to be weak base spells, which impacts their dependency on these talents. Shadowy Apparitions, Mind Blast, Shadowfiend or Mindbender melees, and DoTs are extremely weak baseline.

The only way Shadow Priests can actually counter this kind of mobility problem is to pay for a race change. Dractyhr, Goblin, and Void Elf become our only way to get meaningful movement displacement when other classes have this built into their kit. Nothing in the changes coming in Season 3 make this problem better. Vault of the Heavens or Door of Shadows in the Priest tree please?  Utility​  The other topic that is still painful is our classes group utility. Often times the only thing that makes Priests stick out from the crowd is Power Word: Fortitude, something that Holy and Discipline also bring in addition to Shadow Priests. Giving Shadow some of its own identity when it comes to utility would go a long way.  Shadow Priests do get value out of Vampiric Embrace that Holy and Discipline do not, but this ability has its own flaws that often do not make it valuable. The two big ones are the &quot;smart&quot; heal aspect of Vampiric Embrace being pretty dumb and it being hard to press on-demand when the group actually needs healing. To get good healing out of this we need to be doing good damage, lining this up is typically not something Priests do in this day and age. Would rather the spell just be passive Leech for my party, or something that I can control more that is not tied to my damage as much.  The other big problem with Shadow Priests is how it relates in the current Mythic+ Group Composition meta. There are different requirements for what a healer or dps should bring to a group, and generally speaking our group utility for control is niche and typically weaker than our ranged dps counterparts.  Shackle Undead usually has incredibly niche to no value every season in Mythic+ Why can't this work for more enemy types? Or just call it &quot;Shackle&quot;? Psychic Horror is a severe DPS loss to take (see above section on spec tree utility points)Silence is arguably the worst interrupt in the game for Mythic+ content. Often times the Silence portion of the effect is useless, leading to us just having a long cooldown interrupt.Dominate Mind is either overpowered or useless.Psychic Scream is pulling a lot of weight for us right now as an AoE stop, unfortunately we do have to play in melee to use it though. This was a big problem solved by Mind Bomb (particularly in its stun version) that I still miss to this dayMass Dispel has not only seen significant nerfs, there has also been a notable change in dungeon design limiting its use casesVoid Tendrils goes most seasons with most players forgetting it even exists it is so niche and often useless  Priests have had plenty of utility spells in the past that were useful, but not game breaking that have been taken away from us. Bringing some of these back or shoring up existing utility problems would go a long way to groups being excited about inviting a Shadow Priest into their group.

There are a lot of bugs facing the spec currently, several of which are very impactful to playing the game. The full list is here with the big ones below: Halo is pulling mobs that are not currently in combatVoidheart is expiring earlyVoidwraith pet is taking full damage as if it was a playerDarkening Horizon is not always extending correctlyMind Soothe is not castableIdol of C'Thun is completely broken Season 1 Tier Set Bonus Currently the tier set for Shadow Priests is about a 3% DPS gain going from equivalent gear without the set bonus to equipping the full 4 set. This is particularly due to the strength of Distorted Reality (especially early on with less stats) and the inherent synergy with Mind's Eye. Mind's Eye does gain about 5% with the set but this is not enough to offset the loss at current tuning. In AoE situations the set bonus is about 4%, primarily due to preferring Mind's Eye for these builds. Overall this makes for a pretty underwhelming set bonus effect power wise, and particularly stings because the set bonus is pretty boring as it stands today. Hero Talent Iteration So far we have not seen much iteration on our Hero Talent trees, particularly for Archon. Archon looks exactly how it did when it was first released and not a single thing was ever changed or iterated on, including the actual numerical tuning of the tree. I don't want to repost feedback but this is extremely disappointing and it feels like this just wasn't a priority to work on. While Voidweaver did get some iteration early on there are still quite a few challenges that tree has that would really help to see more iteration and changes with to make it feel better to play, particularly with the way the Entropic Rift spawns and follows targets. Talent Tree Tree Iteration Going into the expansion Shadow Priest has received little to no changes to the base spec. While we have gotten reworks quite often over the years none of these have really ever felt complete and this certainly adds to the frustration when comments made in previous dev cycles of revisiting things like Dark Ascension were never changed in the TWW beta cycle. Furthermore Shadow Priests now have the most 2 point nodes in our tree, and our class tree has the most total points. This equates to 1894837640784 possible builds of our class tree which is obviously an insane number to reason about, but is kind of crazy considering some classes only have a fraction of a percent of that amount. This is not solely indicative of a problem, but does make Priests feel like our tree is not created equally when looking at other classes and specs in the game. This is still causing ugly issues in places like the Shadow spec tree where you have to pick between more DPS or taking the loss to get crucial defensive or utility nodes. As far as I'm aware the design goals were to not have this be a choice but we still have a crowded top section of our talent tree which feels horrible.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Shadow Crash Incident - Voidweaver","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/bookofshadows/blog/shadow-crash-incident","content":"","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Collapsing Void​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Shadow Crash Incident - Voidweaver","url":"/bookofshadows/blog/shadow-crash-incident#collapsing-void","content":" as well as to make Collapsing Void more relevant for encounters with lower health enemies  Overall this is actually a positive change, the length of the Rift was certainly opening the spec up to challenges in shorter lived content so it being balanced around smaller windows makes a lot of sense depending on tuning.

In regards to Devour Matter I'm still unsure how exactly the Shadow Word: Death nodes fit with the Voidweaver theme, but point wise the choice node does make more sense to move it. Devour Matter itself still feels out of place on the tree.  For the new choice node the duration extension now is effectively a choice against Collapsing Void size expansion and damage, which feels like a weird choice depending on where tuning comes into the picture. If the goal is to have shorter lived windows I don't think extending by only 3 seconds is really enough to notice much of an impact considering Void Blast has such a long cooldown.  Overall I think Darkening Horizon makes less sense in this version of Voidweaver, a small amount of extension just isn't enough to feel powerful and feels weak in comparison to Void Empowerment, especially if we are going to have smaller rifts more of them with this design.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Entropic Rift​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Shadow Crash Incident - Voidweaver","url":"/bookofshadows/blog/shadow-crash-incident#entropic-rift","content":" Entropic Rift duration reduced to 8 seconds (was 10 seconds). This change by itself seems okay along with the goal posted above, however it does have some knock on effects with other changes (see below). In addition this also means Shadow has an even harder time empowering the rift and expanding its size since we can only do this with Devouring Plague casts. More than ever it desperately needs to also work with Devouring Plague ticks in order to feel rewarding.  Entropic Rift is now summoned by Shadow Crash instead of Void Torrent. With Shadow Crash being a 20 second cooldown and the Rift only lasting 8 seconds baseline you will now be strongly incentivize to only cast Mind Blast during Rift windows, this can create gameplay that makes Voidweaver much less intuitive. Overall this feels more awkward than it did with being attached to Void Torrent. Having the Rift reset the cooldown of Mind Blast could solve this, but would likely be way too strong and I'm not sure of another way around this that feels healthy.  The spec in general doesn't feel right locking into Shadow Crash everywhere, especially single target. Void Torrent feels good to press almost everywhere so it did not have this problem. Reducing the ramp time of the Entropic Rift (don't have to wait for Void Torrent channel) is slightly improved, but the change from last week felt like a great solve to this in my opinion and I'm sad to see this change from Void Torrent and I personally preferred the older version instead of the Shadow Crash one.  This also creates a lot of problems with damage pattern inside of Mythic+ environments, similar to what was observed during Season 3 of Dragonflight where we pressed Shadow Crash for damage. Adding damage to Shadow Crash makes it really frustrating to play with as its our DoT application spell. If we are trying to get prepped for a pull and DoTing enemies Shadow Crash is now a full-blown damage spell (way more than it was in Season 3). This is also even more frustrating mid-way through a pull when you are faced with a choice of pressing Shadow Crash for damage on this pack vs. holding it for the next one to get your damage going. The spell doesn't create rewarding gameplay when its used for both DoT application and damage.  This change is basically opening up the can of worms of problems with Shadow Crash and personally I think its less fun than when the rift was attached to Void Torrent because of all of this.  Inner Quietus has been redesigned – Shadow Crash deals 400% additional damage to its primary target (was Vampiric Touch and Shadow Word: Pain damage increased by 20%).  This is similar to the points above, adding damage to Shadow Crash just doesn't feel good since we use it for DoT application today and not for damage reasons.

This change overall is extremely polarizing. While this does make the spell easier to target in some cases, it also makes it significantly less useful in other cases. Often times we are able to pre-cast Shadow Crash to time it with mobs spawning (i.e. Sarkareth or 2nd boss Brackenhide), but this is no longer possible with this change. The travel time on the spell also now requiring a target is just solving the problem of it being difficult to target while creating a new problem of being less useful in certain situations.  Instead of making this change I would personally rather have the old version. If this new functionality is the direction the spec is going in I would strongly like to have a similar choice node in our spec tree to what Windwalker Monks have with Skytouch and Skyreach. Give us the ability to choose a cast-on-target Shadow Crash or a ground-target Shadow Crash so that we don't lose our existing functionality but gain the accessability advantages.

Simply to get a more accurate picture for builds/etc in a Mythic+ dungeon. We have always said that doing just one sim will never be good enough for dungeons, since each dungeon changes drastically the damage pattern in the key. With DungeonRoute you now have the ability to check specifically how you might perform in a Halls of Valor +22 key vs. a Azure Vaults +18 key. These sims include all the things you would expect in a key, including downtime, boss pulls, and even some affix support.  While this is not perfectly accurate for every dungeon run, it can be a useful tool especially compared to simply just doing stacked AoE sims.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Sim Charts​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Dungeon Sims","url":"/bookofshadows/guides/dungeonsims#sim-charts","content":" As of this post our sims posted to the Charts Website now use a new sim known as Dungeon Composite. This sims every key at a high level for that season and combines them together to form a single chart. This gives you generic ideas of what to target/shoot for more overall dungeon dps. We also have result tables built for every sim chart for every individual dungeon. Right now those are not visible on the charts website but might be in the future if we figure out a good way to display things. For now you can navigate to the GitHub Repo, select any sim you are interested in and go to the results/dungeons folder to find all the specific dungeon sims.  The routes we use for these sims are found here. See below on how this works.

The way this works is you take a route from Mythic Dungeon Tools and use a WeakAura to generate a SimC string based on that route.  Download Mythic Dungeon ToolsImport or create a route for the key you are interested in simming. Make sure these routes include accurate pulls and include bosses. If you fail to select something it will not be simmed. This also means if you do not create individual pulls it will sim it as if you pull it all at once.Install the MDT Sim WeakAuraFollow the full instructions in the WeakAura description, it will walk you through how to add this to your raidbots sim.

This is similar to DPS found in Warcraftlogs for keys but different from Details which factors this out. This means your overall Details DPS will not match your Sim DPS, and that is expected.

This means it is not nuanced enough to pick up pull differences for various affixes or dungeon mob counts in keys like Court of Stars vs. Algethar Academy.
