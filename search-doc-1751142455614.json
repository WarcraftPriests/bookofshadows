Dark Ascension This talent still existing feels extra out of place now that Mind Spike was removed since our only filler spell is now not buffed with this cooldown, particularly with Surge of Insanity procs. Subservient Shadows Most of the value comes from Idol of C'Thun/Idol of Yogg-Saron and not Shadowfiend or Mindbender. With this current identity it feels a bit misplaced on the tree.This talent does not work with Depth of Shadows (duration effect)Shadowfiend and Mindbender being weak baseline is likely contributing to it feeling underwhelming in this current spot. Madness Weaving Feels pretty lackluster given its place on the talent tree.Weird way to add damage to the specThe spec already likes mastery so its functionality feels misplaced and is not very clear to the average player. Death's Torment Pathing feels like a good spot off of Deathspeaker and the echoes stacking Idol of N'Zoth feels like a good pathing interaction Deathspeaker losing the movement global is a bit disappointing, wish we still had the proc version as a choice nodeReally begins to highlight how weak Shadow Word: Death is baselineWhile this talent on live does interact with Depth of Shadows this current iteration does not. Without adjusting that talent as well we have this weird zone between 35% and 20% health where we have different execute interactions which makes things feel confusing. Shadow Crash Cooldown/charges changes overall feel positiveWith the removal of Deathspeaker as a movement global getting this as a pathing node into Void Torrent can be a decent alternative with Descending Darkness. Unsure how it will feel weaving in Shadow Crash on single target. Descending Darkness while optimizing Shadow Crash damage does give us yet another form of AoE you now have a conflicted sense of using it solely for DoT spreading or Damage. I personally liked not feeling pressured to use it on cooldown but rather being able to mostly just save it for DoTing purposes, and now this is a bit conflicting.On fresh targets DoTs are applied after Shadow Crash deals damage so you lose out on the Mastery modifier here which feels bad, another reason why making this a damage spell is awkward. Void Volley not using its own keybind is awesomethis spell is just super cool and I love it Idol of N'Zoth tooltip is very confusinginsanity generation buffs are currently hidden from your buff bar and combat logDevouring Plague gives 12 stacks regardless of Mind's Eye vs. Distorted Reality, potentially an oversight? Idol of Y'Shaarj This really has nothing to do with pets and does feels out of place on the tree for what it was reworked into.The pathing talents are all pet related, and this talent proccing haste emphasizes a known issue with the game not updating pet melee-swing time in real-time after you get a haste proc. Pets update on a slower interval (roughly ~3 seconds) which makes this node feel even more out of place.feels very feast or famine gameplay which is not typical of this spec.

Since the hidden buff does not reset on combat start with a boss (mostly looking at raid here, should not reset on dungeon bosses) you can use a 2 minute opener to cast two Halo's pre-pull to bank 6 seconds and then cast the third Halo during cooldowns to get 9s of extension on your opener cooldown. This is pretty degenerate and probably shouldn't be a mechanic.Halo being a casted spell adds to the bloat of the opener and feels unsatisfying. We have Shadowfiend or Mindbender + Casted Halo + Casted Dark Ascension/Void Eruption to start our cooldowns.Since Archon interacts with Surge of Insanity, it brings up issues with Mind Flay: Insanity and Mind Spike: Insanity that we brought up earlier. Mind Spike: Insanity feels the same as Mind Spike and not visually different. Compared to Surge of Light being instant-cast these feel much worse.Mind Flay: Insanity feels unsatisfying to press and longer to execute. Impossible to weave many of these into your burst window.Makes Voidform builds, particularly with Mind's Eye feel very cluttered with having extra Surge of Insanity procs during cooldowns, especially with Mind Flay: Insanity. You are even sometimes encouraged to instantly cancel Mind Flay: Insanity just to not waste the Shadowy Apparition.Giving mobility to these spells would help make Archon not only feel different to play, but also add movement into a tree that currently does not have anything The cooldown extension makes Ancient Madness feel less satisfying as it still fizzles out quickly and is still much less valuable with Void Eruption.Currently we use Divine Star to get Insanity pre-pull to start out with 25 when the pull starts. This makes the opener feel much better and because of the way Halo works with the Insanity decay and the fact that we now want it for damage this doesn't become an option anymore since the tree does not work with Divine Star.

This is directly linked to feeling like we cannot quite &quot;cap&quot; the rift size or extension consistently. If that was fixed this might also be better to play with. There is some charm in having to chase the rotation here. Currently Shadow also feels like it has to ramp to get meaningful damage out of the talent, the Void Torrent channel into then spawning the rift and then reaching peak 15 seconds later is a very long time in environments when things do not live that long. Darkening Horizon feels very unachievable to get the full extension without Bloodlust, Power Infusion, and a lot of baseline haste while also getting lucky with procs. Not being able to max this except in rare cases is unsatisfying. Reducing the cooldown of Void Blast, making it Instant Cast, working with other spells as well, and/or increasing how much extension you get per Void Blast would helpChanging it to a spammable spell like Discipline probably would not feel fun, as it would really hurt the value of non-filler spells during this window Collapsing Void Devouring Plague expansion feels extremely underwhelming or even non-existent, even after casting 5 Devouring Plagues the size of the rift is still smaller than 8 yards, which is less than Shadow Crash and by then it fizzles away. Make it work with Devouring Plague ticks and/or significantly increase how much it is increased by per castFantasy element and visually this is extremely underwhelming When a mob dies that was the original target of Entropic Rift, this can feel super unsatisfying, especially if it remains as a small size since it currently does not move or re-target. Would be awesome if an enemy dies in the rift it also expands and &quot;consumes&quot; them Entropic Rift not pulling enemies in feels unsatisfying. For a spell that closely resembles a black hole, I wish it acted more like it. The slow from No Escape is in a similar space but not nearly what I expected. In PvE the applications for the slow are quite underwhelming.The choice node between No Escape and Dark Energy is unsatisfying. At the current size of the rift No Escape feels extremely underwhelming and likely will not have many use cases in PvE at the current size Shadow can get it to. In the current state it feels like Dark Energy will be preferred always. Would love to see additions or changes to No Escape such as the black hole design mentioned above.Adjusting the pacing/sizing that Shadow can get the rift to would certainly help No Escape. The choice node between Devour Matter and Void Empowerment does not feel satisfying. Devour Matter is an extremely niche ability in almost all types of content, where it will only provide a small amount of value even if the condition is met. On the other hand Void Empowerment is always useful and consistent and provides value every 30 seconds with Malediction. If we had this choice node on live, in current examples where we do face enemies with shields (Tindral, Fyrakk, Iridikron) that is such a small portion of the fight, Void Empowerment would still be the better choice. Currently locks you into the bottom right side of our spec talent tree for this spec as Void Torrent, Malediction, and Idol of C'Thun all have such strong synergies. Could be frustrating when taking any Shadow Word: Death points in Voidweaver that also encourage spending points in the bottom left side of our spec tree.In certain cases Shadow might be incentivized to cancel Void Torrent early just to get the rift to spawn sooner. This might just come down to tuning of Void Torrent though. Spawning at the start of the cast would have even more problems depending on tuning of Void Torrent, end is better but that incentive is still there. This is also contributing to having a somewhat length burst/ramp time for our damage. Will take 3 seconds of Void Torrent + up to 15 seconds of the Rift before it collapses, which is a long time for damage especially in environments like Normal dungeons.

This is inconsistent with the talent tooltip and not sure what is intended.There is nothing baseline in-game to track how many times you have extended Entropic Rift (and if you have any left) with Darkening Horizon without using some kind of WeakAura.

(x/8)Void Blast's tooltip shows a low number for ShadowVisual of Entropic Rift can be hard to see in certain environments on the ground, and because it does not re-target after the original dies this is important to know where to drag mobs into, especially for your Tank in PvE environments. The rift not re-targeting after the original dies is also unintuitive.  Entropic Rift Windows  [quote=&quot;Publik-thrall, post:2, topic:1833178&quot;] Current Entropic Rift window feels very busy and borderline overwhelming and you are rushing to try and get Void Blasts and Devouring Plagues out and do not have room to do much else. This is directly linked to feeling like we cannot quite “cap” the rift size or extension consistently. If that was fixed this might also be better to play with. There is some charm in having to chase the rotation here. [/quote]  After spending a bit more time with Voidweaver I wanted to clarify this comment a bit since I was pretty vague in this statement.  The Entropic Rift window specifically for Shadow Priests has a varying degree of pure gameplay feel based on other talents that we are picking. Particularly if you are playing a build with Void Eruption and especially worse if you also have Inescapable Torment. With Void Eruption you inevitably have to sacrifice some casts of spells like Void Bolt to prioritize Entropic Rift casts in a way that makes it feel busy.  There's enough rotational pressure from Void Blasts, Devouring Plague (and Shadow Word: Death if you have Inescapable Torment) to make the windows feel rewarding that adding the additional rotational pressure of Void Bolt detracts from the experience and makes it feel significantly less rewarding.  For a Hero Talent tree that has Void in the name Void Eruption does not have great synergies with these spells. Void Eruption as a cooldown is primarily focused around Void Bolt, which doesn't have any direct synergies with Voidweaver. We only rarely will reach maximum extension of the rift duration from very lucky procs, and by doing so we are de-prioritizing Void Bolts.  For other builds that do not use Void Eruption the Rift itself brings a much welcomed pacing into the build that feels like you are working towards something. That something is still a bit uninspiring at the current size of the rift, but that was covered in a different section. Expanding the rift size in general feels lackluster as a Shadow Priest (much better as Discipline).  I think there should be some kind of sweet spot the build lives where expanding the rifts size should feel exciting and rewarding, and the extension of the rift duration should be easy to get a few casts, and reward players that are more skillful with the full extension. For Shadow Priests the rift expansion is extremely underwhelming and it feels like we can almost never get the full duration extension off, even while playing perfectly.  Opener Concerns and Setup Time  Another point I didn't get to focus on earlier was the opener itself into the Entropic Rift. As a goal we are encouraged to have our DoTs active before pressing Void Torrent, but with how we start off pulls currently we are heavily incentivized to just cast Void Torrent for one tick and then cancel to spawn the rift just to get into the start of our opener. Casting Void Torrent just into Vampiric Touch and Shadow Word: Pain on the opener just isn't worth full channeling, and sitting there building up to 45/50/55 Insanity for Devouring Plague (depending on talents) is quite a long wait for our cooldown cycle.  This is certainly part of tuning overall, but is something we are noticing with the opener and setup of a Voidweaver Shadow Priest that is a bit awkward to play with currently.  Pathing and Build Diversity  The other big thing related to this is how the tree is currently pressuring you to not only pickup Void Torrent, Malediction, and Idol of C'Thun in the bottom section, but talents like Depth of Shadows or Voidwraith also pull you towards Mindbender, Inescapable Torment, and Idol of Y'Shaarj (assuming bugs are worked out/intended to work with these). Mastermind is also an extremely valuable point with any build due to the strength of Void Blast.  Encouraging and locking into the bottom right section is totally expected with the core of Entropic Rift, but it just gets a bit much when we are also heavily encouraged to path on the complete opposite side of the tree, not to mention thematically the Shadow Word: Death and Pet-focused spells don't exactly fit the Void theme as well as other nodes.

Neither of these are particularly related to the Void but do end up in several places on the tree: Devour Matter, Depth of Shadows, and Voidwraith. Personally I do not see how these fit together in the build and end up making our points in the spec tree feel even more restrictive. Devour Matter is definitely the odd one out here, it is a pretty boring node that I often forget even exists.  The last big thing with Voidweaver that does not feel very satisfying is the size of the Rift and the expansion. Because of how little we end up casting Devouring Plague rotationally this expansion is very minor, especially compared to Discipline. Making this work with ticks of Devouring Plague or adjusting how much it grows per cast would go a long way to making this be more usable. With the current size of the rift and positioning of a pack in Mythic+ it could be awkwardly missing a lot of mobs. This is also notably worse off because the Rift does not currently retarget if the original target dies.

The playstyle is basically the baseline version of the spec we have in Dragonflight, you just now press Halo at the start of your cooldowns. It is possible this was the goal all along for Archon, but having a relatively small change to the spec for a whole Hero talent feel wise does not make it feel like a Hero Talent to me.  This is made even worse with the lack of distinct visual changes with Archon. Yes we spawn a few extra Halos and it radiates out and back to us, but for a spec themed around empowering our cooldowns this just misses the mark for me when our cooldowns are lacking any visual change. Even the Hero Talent icon itself looks amazing but feels really out of place considering the visuals and feel of the spec do not match.  Archon itself is likely suffering from an already existing problem the spec has with cooldowns that are not particularly exciting by themselves (particularly Dark Ascension).  The one thing that Archon has going for it that might even make us feel pulled to play it is the absolutely disgusting amount of off-healing we get from being centered around Halo.

This is particularly due to the strength of Distorted Reality (especially early on with less stats) and the inherent synergy with Mind's Eye. Mind's Eye does gain about 5% with the set but this is not enough to offset the loss at current tuning. In AoE situations the set bonus is about 4%, primarily due to preferring Mind's Eye for these builds. Overall this makes for a pretty underwhelming set bonus effect power wise, and particularly stings because the set bonus is pretty boring as it stands today. Hero Talent Iteration So far we have not seen much iteration on our Hero Talent trees, particularly for Archon. Archon looks exactly how it did when it was first released and not a single thing was ever changed or iterated on, including the actual numerical tuning of the tree. I don't want to repost feedback but this is extremely disappointing and it feels like this just wasn't a priority to work on. While Voidweaver did get some iteration early on there are still quite a few challenges that tree has that would really help to see more iteration and changes with to make it feel better to play, particularly with the way the Entropic Rift spawns and follows targets. Talent Tree Tree Iteration Going into the expansion Shadow Priest has received little to no changes to the base spec. While we have gotten reworks quite often over the years none of these have really ever felt complete and this certainly adds to the frustration when comments made in previous dev cycles of revisiting things like Dark Ascension were never changed in the TWW beta cycle. Furthermore Shadow Priests now have the most 2 point nodes in our tree, and our class tree has the most total points. This equates to 1894837640784 possible builds of our class tree which is obviously an insane number to reason about, but is kind of crazy considering some classes only have a fraction of a percent of that amount. This is not solely indicative of a problem, but does make Priests feel like our tree is not created equally when looking at other classes and specs in the game. This is still causing ugly issues in places like the Shadow spec tree where you have to pick between more DPS or taking the loss to get crucial defensive or utility nodes. As far as I'm aware the design goals were to not have this be a choice but we still have a crowded top section of our talent tree which feels horrible.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Shadow Crash Incident - Voidweaver","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/bookofshadows/blog/shadow-crash-incident","content":"","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Collapsing Void​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Shadow Crash Incident - Voidweaver","url":"/bookofshadows/blog/shadow-crash-incident#collapsing-void","content":" as well as to make Collapsing Void more relevant for encounters with lower health enemies  Overall this is actually a positive change, the length of the Rift was certainly opening the spec up to challenges in shorter lived content so it being balanced around smaller windows makes a lot of sense depending on tuning.

In regards to Devour Matter I'm still unsure how exactly the Shadow Word: Death nodes fit with the Voidweaver theme, but point wise the choice node does make more sense to move it. Devour Matter itself still feels out of place on the tree.  For the new choice node the duration extension now is effectively a choice against Collapsing Void size expansion and damage, which feels like a weird choice depending on where tuning comes into the picture. If the goal is to have shorter lived windows I don't think extending by only 3 seconds is really enough to notice much of an impact considering Void Blast has such a long cooldown.  Overall I think Darkening Horizon makes less sense in this version of Voidweaver, a small amount of extension just isn't enough to feel powerful and feels weak in comparison to Void Empowerment, especially if we are going to have smaller rifts more of them with this design.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Entropic Rift​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Shadow Crash Incident - Voidweaver","url":"/bookofshadows/blog/shadow-crash-incident#entropic-rift","content":" Entropic Rift duration reduced to 8 seconds (was 10 seconds). This change by itself seems okay along with the goal posted above, however it does have some knock on effects with other changes (see below). In addition this also means Shadow has an even harder time empowering the rift and expanding its size since we can only do this with Devouring Plague casts. More than ever it desperately needs to also work with Devouring Plague ticks in order to feel rewarding.  Entropic Rift is now summoned by Shadow Crash instead of Void Torrent. With Shadow Crash being a 20 second cooldown and the Rift only lasting 8 seconds baseline you will now be strongly incentivize to only cast Mind Blast during Rift windows, this can create gameplay that makes Voidweaver much less intuitive. Overall this feels more awkward than it did with being attached to Void Torrent. Having the Rift reset the cooldown of Mind Blast could solve this, but would likely be way too strong and I'm not sure of another way around this that feels healthy.  The spec in general doesn't feel right locking into Shadow Crash everywhere, especially single target. Void Torrent feels good to press almost everywhere so it did not have this problem. Reducing the ramp time of the Entropic Rift (don't have to wait for Void Torrent channel) is slightly improved, but the change from last week felt like a great solve to this in my opinion and I'm sad to see this change from Void Torrent and I personally preferred the older version instead of the Shadow Crash one.  This also creates a lot of problems with damage pattern inside of Mythic+ environments, similar to what was observed during Season 3 of Dragonflight where we pressed Shadow Crash for damage. Adding damage to Shadow Crash makes it really frustrating to play with as its our DoT application spell. If we are trying to get prepped for a pull and DoTing enemies Shadow Crash is now a full-blown damage spell (way more than it was in Season 3). This is also even more frustrating mid-way through a pull when you are faced with a choice of pressing Shadow Crash for damage on this pack vs. holding it for the next one to get your damage going. The spell doesn't create rewarding gameplay when its used for both DoT application and damage.  This change is basically opening up the can of worms of problems with Shadow Crash and personally I think its less fun than when the rift was attached to Void Torrent because of all of this.  Inner Quietus has been redesigned – Shadow Crash deals 400% additional damage to its primary target (was Vampiric Touch and Shadow Word: Pain damage increased by 20%).  This is similar to the points above, adding damage to Shadow Crash just doesn't feel good since we use it for DoT application today and not for damage reasons.

This change overall is extremely polarizing. While this does make the spell easier to target in some cases, it also makes it significantly less useful in other cases. Often times we are able to pre-cast Shadow Crash to time it with mobs spawning (i.e. Sarkareth or 2nd boss Brackenhide), but this is no longer possible with this change. The travel time on the spell also now requiring a target is just solving the problem of it being difficult to target while creating a new problem of being less useful in certain situations.  Instead of making this change I would personally rather have the old version. If this new functionality is the direction the spec is going in I would strongly like to have a similar choice node in our spec tree to what Windwalker Monks have with Skytouch and Skyreach. Give us the ability to choose a cast-on-target Shadow Crash or a ground-target Shadow Crash so that we don't lose our existing functionality but gain the accessability advantages.
