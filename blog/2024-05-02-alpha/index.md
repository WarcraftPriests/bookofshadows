# Alpha Feedback - Archon
The following feedback is from the perspective of a Shadow Priest.

You can find all current bugs for Priests in The War Within [here](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%222-The+War+Within%22+label%3APriest).

## Hero Talents that you feel are “required” for your spec in a type of content, such as raiding or Mythic+, or that push you towards picking a specific tree.
- Word of Supremacy for Archon would make you feel pushed toward the tree when trying to live high-key Mythic+ dungeons compared to Voidweaver

## Any bugs blocking testing?
- Animation of Halo does not seem to match when the damage happens, but the Holy version seems to match.
- As an Archon Priest if someone else casts Power Infusion on you while yours is active, it will remove your existing Power Infusion buff completely.
- If you are mid-cast of Mind Spike and get a proc of Mind Spike: Insanity from a Halo creation it will consume the Surge of Insanity and not give you the increased damage. It should either buff the damage or not consume the proc (which is what Mind Flay: Insanity does). This also does not generate a Shadowy Apparition from this bug.

## Hero Talents that Create Frustrating or Unsatisfying gameplay
- Sustained Potency 2minute opener degeneracy
- Halo being a casted spell adds to the bloat of the opener and feels unsatisfying
- Since Archon interacts with Surge of Insanity it brings up issues that Mind Flay: Insanity and Mind Spike: Insanity have
  - Mind Spike: Insanity feels the same as Mind Spike and not visually different. Compared to Surge of Light being instant-cast these feel much worse.
  - Mind Flay: Insanity feels unsatisfying to press and longer to execute
  - Makes Voidform builds particularly with Mind's Eye feel very cluttered with having extra Surge of Insanity procs during cooldowns, especially with Mind Flay: Insanity. You are even sometimes encouraged to instantly cancel Mind Flay: Insanity just to not waste the Shadowy Apparition.
- The cooldown extension makes Ancient Madness feel less satisfying as it still fizzles out quickly and is still much less valuable with Void Eruption.

## Hero Talents where Functionality is Confusing, Unclear, or Difficult to Track
- Sustained Potency stacks outside of your cooldown (buff should not be hidden)
- Dark Ascension Perfected Form modifier is applying twice to Direct spell damage, and not to any periodic.
- Void Eruption Perfected Form is an additive effect instead of multiplicative with the existing modifier
- Resonant Energy debuff stacking is confusing since the damage taken increase does not stack, just the slow
- The extra Halo's generated from Power Surge not giving Insanity is unclear if that is intended
- Power Surge has no buff to track when the future Halo's are happening


## Positives
- Uncapped Halo
- Off-healing

## Negatives
- Surge of Insanity + Shadowy Apparition nodes feel out of place
- Heightened Alteration working for Dispersion doesn't feel like its giving us much
- Not a whole lot of synergy with our spec talents
- Lack of coherency between nodes
- For an "ultimate" version of ourselves our cooldowns dont _feel_ that empowered, especially not visually
- Animation of Halo seems kind of lackluster as Shadow
