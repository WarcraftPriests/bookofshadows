            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent changes on the Alpha are quite unexpected and overall have me feeling quite disappointed and sad that we lost certain interactions. Overall these changes create more problems than they end up solving in the first place and my inclination is to revert back to previous iterations. More details below, starting from the top of the changes.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="collapsing-void">Collapsing Void<a href="https://warcraftpriests.github.io/bookofshadows/blog/alpha-feedback-voidweaver#collapsing-void" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Collapsing Void" title="Direct link to Collapsing Void">​</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>as well as to make Collapsing Void more relevant for encounters with lower health enemies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall this is actually a positive change, the length of the Rift was certainly opening the spec up to challenges in shorter lived content so it being balanced around smaller windows makes a lot of sense depending on tuning.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="devour-matter-and-void-empowerment">Devour Matter and Void Empowerment<a href="https://warcraftpriests.github.io/bookofshadows/blog/alpha-feedback-voidweaver#devour-matter-and-void-empowerment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Devour Matter and Void Empowerment" title="Direct link to Devour Matter and Void Empowerment">​</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition, Devour Matter felt like an odd choice against Void Empowerment, so now it is a node that you are guaranteed to have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to Devour Matter I'm still unsure how exactly the Shadow Word: Death nodes fit with the Voidweaver theme, but point wise the choice node does make more sense to move it. Devour Matter itself still feels out of place on the tree.</p>
<p>For the new choice node the duration extension now is effectively a choice against Collapsing Void size expansion and damage, which feels like a weird choice depending on where tuning comes into the picture. If the goal is to have shorter lived windows I don't think extending by only 3 seconds is really enough to notice much of an impact considering Void Blast has such a long cooldown.</p>
<p>Overall I think Darkening Horizon makes less sense in this version of Voidweaver, a small amount of extension just isn't enough to feel powerful and feels weak in comparison to Void Empowerment, especially if we are going to have smaller rifts more of them with this design.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="entropic-rift">Entropic Rift<a href="https://warcraftpriests.github.io/bookofshadows/blog/alpha-feedback-voidweaver#entropic-rift" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Entropic Rift" title="Direct link to Entropic Rift">​</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Entropic Rift duration reduced to 8 seconds (was 10 seconds).
This change by itself seems okay along with the goal posted above, however it does have some knock on effects with other changes (see below). In addition this also means Shadow has an even harder time empowering the rift and expanding its size since we can only do this with Devouring Plague casts. More than ever it desperately needs to also work with Devouring Plague ticks in order to feel rewarding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Entropic Rift is now summoned by Shadow Crash instead of Void Torrent.
With Shadow Crash being a 20 second cooldown and the Rift only lasting 8 seconds baseline you will now be strongly incentivize to only cast Mind Blast during Rift windows, this can create gameplay that makes Voidweaver much less intuitive. Overall this feels more awkward than it did with being attached to Void Torrent. Having the Rift reset the cooldown of Mind Blast could solve this, but would likely be way too strong and I'm not sure of another way around this that feels healthy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spec in general doesn't feel right locking into Shadow Crash everywhere, especially single target. Void Torrent feels good to press almost everywhere so it did not have this problem. Reducing the ramp time of the Entropic Rift (don't have to wait for Void Torrent channel) is slightly improved, but the change from last week felt like a great solve to this in my opinion and I'm sad to see this change from Void Torrent and I personally preferred the older version instead of the Shadow Crash one.</p>
<p>This also creates a lot of problems with damage pattern inside of Mythic+ environments, similar to what was observed during Season 3 of Dragonflight where we pressed Shadow Crash for damage. Adding damage to Shadow Crash makes it really frustrating to play with as its our DoT application spell. If we are trying to get prepped for a pull and DoTing enemies Shadow Crash is now a full-blown damage spell (way more than it was in Season 3). This is also even more frustrating mid-way through a pull when you are faced with a choice of pressing Shadow Crash for damage on this pack vs. holding it for the next one to get your damage going. The spell doesn't create rewarding gameplay when its used for both DoT application and damage.</p>
<p>This change is basically opening up the can of worms of problems with <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/shadow-priest-dragonflight-feedback/1819255#unsatisfying-dot-management-options-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow Crash</a> and personally I think its less fun than when the rift was attached to Void Torrent because of all of this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inner Quietus has been redesigned – Shadow Crash deals 400% additional damage to its primary target (was Vampiric Touch and Shadow Word: Pain damage increased by 20%).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is similar to the points above, adding damage to Shadow Crash just doesn't feel good since we use it for DoT application today and not for damage reasons.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="shadow-crash">Shadow Crash<a href="https://warcraftpriests.github.io/bookofshadows/blog/alpha-feedback-voidweaver#shadow-crash" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Shadow Crash" title="Direct link to Shadow Crash">​</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Shadow Crash now centers on your target, rather than using a reticle to target a position on the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This change overall is extremely polarizing. While this does make the spell easier to target in some cases, it also makes it significantly less useful in other cases. Often times we are able to pre-cast Shadow Crash to time it with mobs spawning (i.e. Sarkareth or 2nd boss Brackenhide), but this is no longer possible with this change. The travel time on the spell also now requiring a target is just solving the problem of it being difficult to target while creating a new problem of being less useful in certain situations.</p>
<p>Instead of making this change I would personally rather have the old version. If this new functionality is the direction the spec is going in I would strongly like to have a similar choice node in our spec tree to what Windwalker Monks have with Skytouch and Skyreach. Give us the ability to choose a cast-on-target Shadow Crash or a ground-target Shadow Crash so that we don't lose our existing functionality but gain the accessability advantages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[The following feedback is from the perspective of a Shadow Priest.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following feedback is from the perspective of a Shadow Priest.</p>
<p>Overall Archon starts to deliver on the fantasy of enhanced cooldowns, but does it in a way with Halo that does not quite fit together nicely as a Shadow Priest. The empowered cooldowns themselves also do not feel particularly different than normally, they just now last a bit longer and you press Halo beforehand. That being said the iteration we see now does look powerful, although I wish it had more than just an updated Halo visual to enhance the theme, particularly with our cooldowns or Surge of Insanity casts. The Halo visual change itself also feels a bit lackluster for Shadow in particular and not sure I prefer it over the current version.</p>
<p>Surge of Insanity casts and Shadowy Apparitions don't feel super connected to the tree, but could be a big point to develop a visually different experience as an Archon.</p>
<p>The description for Archon says, "Archons can be blessed from higher beings to enter into an ascended state, becoming an ultimate version of themselves". The current version of the tree doesn't have enough changing with our cooldowns to actually make them feel like ultimate versions, both visually and playstyle wise. There are plenty of buffs to the cooldowns themselves but other than that it doesn't hit the theme well enough for me, especially compared to Voidweaver. Dark Ascension and Void Eruption are both a bit lacking in terms of identity, this could be a good time to revisiting <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/shadow-priest-dragonflight-feedback/1819255#cooldown-identity-crisis-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this feedback</a>.</p>
<p>All current bugs for Priests in The War Within are listed <a href="https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%222-The+War+Within%22+label%3APriest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Word of Supremacy for Archon would make you feel pushed toward the tree when trying to live high-key Mythic+ dungeons compared to Voidweaver</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Animation of Halo does not seem to match when the damage happens</a>, but the Holy version seems to match.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As an Archon Priest, if someone else casts Power Infusion on you while yours is active, it will remove your existing Power Infusion buff completely.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SimCMinMax/WoW-BugTracker/issues/1192" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">If you are mid-cast of Mind Spike and get a proc of Mind Spike: Insanity from a Halo creation it will consume the Surge of Insanity and not give you the increased damage</a>. It should either buff the damage or not consume the proc (which is what Mind Flay: Insanity does). This also does not generate a Shadowy Apparition from this bug.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hero-talents-that-create-frustrating-or-unsatisfying-gameplay">Hero Talents that Create Frustrating or Unsatisfying gameplay<a href="https://warcraftpriests.github.io/bookofshadows/blog/alpha-feedback-archon#hero-talents-that-create-frustrating-or-unsatisfying-gameplay" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hero Talents that Create Frustrating or Unsatisfying gameplay" title="Direct link to Hero Talents that Create Frustrating or Unsatisfying gameplay">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Current iteration of Sustained Potency means that you can gain damage using a 2-minute "opener". Since the hidden buff does not reset on combat start with a boss (mostly looking at raid here, should not reset on dungeon bosses) you can use a 2 minute opener to cast two Halo's pre-pull to bank 6 seconds and then cast the third Halo during cooldowns to get 9s of extension on your opener cooldown. This is pretty degenerate and probably shouldn't be a mechanic.</li>
<li>Halo being a casted spell adds to the bloat of the opener and feels unsatisfying. We have Shadowfiend or Mindbender + Casted Halo + Casted Dark Ascension/Void Eruption to start our cooldowns.</li>
<li>Since Archon interacts with Surge of Insanity, it brings up issues with Mind Flay: Insanity and Mind Spike: Insanity <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/shadow-priest-dragonflight-feedback/1819255#filler-spell-insanity-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that we brought up earlier</a>.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Mind Spike: Insanity feels the same as Mind Spike and not visually different. Compared to Surge of Light being instant-cast these feel much worse.</li>
<li>Mind Flay: Insanity feels unsatisfying to press and longer to execute. Impossible to weave many of these into your burst window.</li>
<li>Makes Voidform builds, particularly with Mind's Eye feel very cluttered with having extra Surge of Insanity procs during cooldowns, especially with Mind Flay: Insanity. You are even sometimes encouraged to instantly cancel Mind Flay: Insanity just to not waste the Shadowy Apparition.</li>
<li>Giving mobility to these spells would help make Archon not only feel different to play, but also add movement into a tree that currently does not have anything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The cooldown extension makes Ancient Madness feel less satisfying as it still fizzles out quickly and is still much less valuable with Void Eruption.</li>
<li>Currently we use Divine Star to get Insanity pre-pull to start out with 25 when the pull starts. This makes the opener feel much better and because of the way Halo works with the Insanity decay and the fact that we now want it for damage this doesn't become an option anymore since the tree does not work with Divine Star.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hero-talents-where-functionality-is-confusing-unclear-or-difficult-to-track">Hero Talents where Functionality is Confusing, Unclear, or Difficult to Track<a href="https://warcraftpriests.github.io/bookofshadows/blog/alpha-feedback-archon#hero-talents-where-functionality-is-confusing-unclear-or-difficult-to-track" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hero Talents where Functionality is Confusing, Unclear, or Difficult to Track" title="Direct link to Hero Talents where Functionality is Confusing, Unclear, or Difficult to Track">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Halo's range currently is increased to 40 yards, but in reality its closer to 37 or so. Standing exactly 40 yards away from the target you will not get any hits of Halo. This same problem exists today on live/without Archon but at 27 yards instead of 30.</li>
<li>Heightened Alteration working for Dispersion doesn't feel like its giving us much. More duration is not something that is very useful. Not really sure what this was intended to give the spec.</li>
<li>Sustained Potency stacks outside of your cooldown (buff should not be hidden)</li>
<li>Dark Ascension Perfected Form modifier is applying twice to Direct spell damage, and not to any periodic.</li>
<li>Void Eruption Perfected Form is an additive effect instead of multiplicative with the existing modifier, this is confusing and slightly low-balling the damage increase</li>
<li>Resonant Energy debuff stacking is confusing since the damage taken increase does not stack, just the slow</li>
<li>The extra Halo's generated from Power Surge not giving Insanity is unclear if that is intended</li>
<li>Power Surge has no buff to track when the future Halo's are happening</li>
