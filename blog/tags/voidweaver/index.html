<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="voidweaver">Voidweaver<a href="#voidweaver" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Voidweaver" title="Direct link to Voidweaver">â</a></h2>
<p>Overall this spec feels pretty great, but there are a couple of things that if changed could make it play even better.</p>
<p>One of the most frustrating moments right now when playing Voidweaver is getting Shadowy Insight procs while banking up for your next Entropic Rift. Because of a change made to make Shadowy Insight no longer grant a temporary charge of Mind Blast, these procs can often be completely wasted. We are incentivized to bank of Mind Blasts right before Void Torrents but these procs happening right before can end up being very frustrating.</p>
<p>The other thing that is still a bit weird is the emphasis around Shadow Word: Death and Shadowfiend spells. Neither of these are particularly related to the Void but do end up in several places on the tree: Devour Matter, Depth of Shadows, and Voidwraith. Personally I do not see how these fit together in the build and end up making our points in the spec tree feel even more restrictive. Devour Matter is definitely the odd one out here, it is a pretty boring node that I often forget even exists.</p>
<p>The last big thing with Voidweaver that does not feel very satisfying is the size of the Rift and the expansion. Because of how little we end up casting Devouring Plague rotationally this expansion is very minor, especially compared to Discipline. Making this work with ticks of Devouring Plague or adjusting how much it grows per cast would go a long way to making this be more usable. With the current size of the rift and positioning of a pack in Mythic+ it could be awkwardly missing a lot of mobs. This is also notably worse off because the Rift does not currently retarget if the original target dies.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="archon">Archon<a href="#archon" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Archon" title="Direct link to Archon">â</a></h2>
<p>Compared to Voidweaver, Archon is particularly uninspiring to play with. The playstyle is basically the baseline version of the spec we have in Dragonflight, you just now press Halo at the start of your cooldowns. It is possible this was the goal all along for Archon, but having a relatively small change to the spec for a whole Hero talent feel wise does not make it feel like a Hero Talent to me.</p>
<p>This is made even worse with the lack of distinct visual changes with Archon. Yes we spawn a few extra Halos and it radiates out and back to us, but for a spec themed around empowering our cooldowns this just misses the mark for me when our cooldowns are lacking any visual change. Even the Hero Talent icon itself looks amazing but feels really out of place considering the visuals and feel of the spec do not match.</p>
<p>Archon itself is likely suffering from an already existing problem the spec has with cooldowns that are not particularly exciting by themselves (particularly Dark Ascension).</p>
<p>The one thing that Archon has going for it that might even make us feel pulled to play it is the absolutely disgusting amount of off-healing we get from being centered around Halo. Not sure how this will be balanced but that is a strong positive.</p>

<p>While I already covered recent changes <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/feedback-priests/1870412/91" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> I wanted to discuss a few other points that I would love to see discussion or changes towards.</p>
<p>We have not seen any spec tree changes so I do not want to copy things from my <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/shadow-priest-dragonflight-feedback/1819255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</a> but these issues are generally all still present and would welcome any changes here to help improve our spec tree.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="shadow-crash-and-void-crash">Shadow Crash and Void Crash<a href="#shadow-crash-and-void-crash" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Shadow Crash and Void Crash" title="Direct link to Shadow Crash and Void Crash">â</a></h3>
<p>Adding in Void Crash as an alternative to Shadow Crash will be a welcomed change for some players, but also creates some anti-patterns with the current size of the spell. Because of the relatively small radius of Shadow and Void Crash (8 yards), having it be centered around a single enemy can easily make it difficult to target a full clump of adds. This can also be quite confusing for new players using the talent. Increasing this up to 10 or 12 yards (likely alongside Shadow Crash) would make it feel much better from a DoT management perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as well as to make Collapsing Void more relevant for encounters with lower health enemies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall this is actually a positive change, the length of the Rift was certainly opening the spec up to challenges in shorter lived content so it being balanced around smaller windows makes a lot of sense depending on tuning.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="devour-matter-and-void-empowerment">Devour Matter and Void Empowerment<a href="#devour-matter-and-void-empowerment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Devour Matter and Void Empowerment" title="Direct link to Devour Matter and Void Empowerment">â</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition, Devour Matter felt like an odd choice against Void Empowerment, so now it is a node that you are guaranteed to have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to Devour Matter I&#x27;m still unsure how exactly the Shadow Word: Death nodes fit with the Voidweaver theme, but point wise the choice node does make more sense to move it. Devour Matter itself still feels out of place on the tree.</p>
<p>For the new choice node the duration extension now is effectively a choice against Collapsing Void size expansion and damage, which feels like a weird choice depending on where tuning comes into the picture. If the goal is to have shorter lived windows I don&#x27;t think extending by only 3 seconds is really enough to notice much of an impact considering Void Blast has such a long cooldown.</p>
<p>Overall I think Darkening Horizon makes less sense in this version of Voidweaver, a small amount of extension just isn&#x27;t enough to feel powerful and feels weak in comparison to Void Empowerment, especially if we are going to have smaller rifts more of them with this design.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="entropic-rift">Entropic Rift<a href="#entropic-rift" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Entropic Rift" title="Direct link to Entropic Rift">â</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Entropic Rift duration reduced to 8 seconds (was 10 seconds).
This change by itself seems okay along with the goal posted above, however it does have some knock on effects with other changes (see below). In addition this also means Shadow has an even harder time empowering the rift and expanding its size since we can only do this with Devouring Plague casts. More than ever it desperately needs to also work with Devouring Plague ticks in order to feel rewarding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Entropic Rift is now summoned by Shadow Crash instead of Void Torrent.
With Shadow Crash being a 20 second cooldown and the Rift only lasting 8 seconds baseline you will now be strongly incentivize to only cast Mind Blast during Rift windows, this can create gameplay that makes Voidweaver much less intuitive. Overall this feels more awkward than it did with being attached to Void Torrent. Having the Rift reset the cooldown of Mind Blast could solve this, but would likely be way too strong and I&#x27;m not sure of another way around this that feels healthy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spec in general doesn&#x27;t feel right locking into Shadow Crash everywhere, especially single target. Void Torrent feels good to press almost everywhere so it did not have this problem. Reducing the ramp time of the Entropic Rift (don&#x27;t have to wait for Void Torrent channel) is slightly improved, but the change from last week felt like a great solve to this in my opinion and I&#x27;m sad to see this change from Void Torrent and I personally preferred the older version instead of the Shadow Crash one.</p>
<p>This also creates a lot of problems with damage pattern inside of Mythic+ environments, similar to what was observed during Season 3 of Dragonflight where we pressed Shadow Crash for damage. Adding damage to Shadow Crash makes it really frustrating to play with as its our DoT application spell. If we are trying to get prepped for a pull and DoTing enemies Shadow Crash is now a full-blown damage spell (way more than it was in Season 3). This is also even more frustrating mid-way through a pull when you are faced with a choice of pressing Shadow Crash for damage on this pack vs. holding it for the next one to get your damage going. The spell doesn&#x27;t create rewarding gameplay when its used for both DoT application and damage.</p>
<p>This change is basically opening up the can of worms of problems with <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/shadow-priest-dragonflight-feedback/1819255#unsatisfying-dot-management-options-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow Crash</a> and personally I think its less fun than when the rift was attached to Void Torrent because of all of this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inner Quietus has been redesigned â Shadow Crash deals 400% additional damage to its primary target (was Vampiric Touch and Shadow Word: Pain damage increased by 20%).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is similar to the points above, adding damage to Shadow Crash just doesn&#x27;t feel good since we use it for DoT application today and not for damage reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shadow Crash now centers on your target, rather than using a reticle to target a position on the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This change overall is extremely polarizing. While this does make the spell easier to target in some cases, it also makes it significantly less useful in other cases. Often times we are able to pre-cast Shadow Crash to time it with mobs spawning (i.e. Sarkareth or 2nd boss Brackenhide), but this is no longer possible with this change. The travel time on the spell also now requiring a target is just solving the problem of it being difficult to target while creating a new problem of being less useful in certain situations.</p>
<p>Instead of making this change I would personally rather have the old version. If this new functionality is the direction the spec is going in I would strongly like to have a similar choice node in our spec tree to what Windwalker Monks have with Skytouch and Skyreach. Give us the ability to choose a cast-on-target Shadow Crash or a ground-target Shadow Crash so that we don&#x27;t lose our existing functionality but gain the accessability advantages.</p>

<p>After these changes the tree feels more directionless and we have a lot of nodes working with unrelated abilities. While the Entropic Rift was changed to Shadow Crash, we still have a node that makes Void Torrent cast while moving, which is still a cool node but now feels way more random unless we revert that change. Personally would love for this to be more focused to make building around Voidweaver feel more distinct. Shadow Word: Death and Mindbender nodes in particular still feel out of place, equally so with Void Torrent/Shadow Crash conflicting.</p>

<li>Entropic Rift not pulling enemies in feels unsatisfying. For a spell that closely resembles a black hole, I wish it acted more like it. The slow from No Escape is in a similar space but not nearly what I expected. In PvE the applications for the slow are quite underwhelming.</li>
<li>The choice node between No Escape and Dark Energy is unsatisfying.

</ul>
</li>
<li>The choice node between Devour Matter and Void Empowerment does not feel satisfying. Devour Matter is an extremely niche ability in almost all types of content, where it will only provide a small amount of value even if the condition is met.

<li>Currently locks you into the bottom right side of our spec talent tree for this spec as Void Torrent, Malediction, and Idol of C&#x27;Thun all have such strong synergies.

<li>In certain cases Shadow might be incentivized to cancel Void Torrent early just to get the rift to spawn sooner. This might just come down to tuning of Void Torrent though. Spawning at the start of the cast would have even more problems depending on tuning of Void Torrent, end is better but that incentive is still there. This is also contributing to having a somewhat length burst/ramp time for our damage. Will take 3 seconds of Void Torrent + up to 15 seconds of the Rift before it collapses, which is a long time for damage especially in environments like Normal dungeons.</li>

<h1>Entropic Rift Windows</h1>
<p>[quote=&quot;Publik-thrall, post:2, topic:1833178&quot;]
Current Entropic Rift window feels very busy and borderline overwhelming and you are rushing to try and get Void Blasts and Devouring Plagues out and do not have room to do much else. This is directly linked to feeling like we cannot quite âcapâ the rift size or extension consistently. If that was fixed this might also be better to play with. There is some charm in having to chase the rotation here.
[/quote]</p>
<p>After spending a bit more time with Voidweaver I wanted to clarify this comment a bit since I was pretty vague in this statement.</p>
<p>The Entropic Rift window specifically for Shadow Priests has a varying degree of pure gameplay feel based on other talents that we are picking. Particularly if you are playing a build with Void Eruption and especially worse if you also have Inescapable Torment. With Void Eruption you inevitably have to sacrifice some casts of spells like Void Bolt to prioritize Entropic Rift casts in a way that makes it feel busy.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s enough rotational pressure from Void Blasts, Devouring Plague (and Shadow Word: Death if you have Inescapable Torment) to make the windows feel rewarding that adding the additional rotational pressure of Void Bolt detracts from the experience and makes it feel significantly less rewarding.</p>
<p>For a Hero Talent tree that has Void in the name Void Eruption does not have great synergies with these spells. Void Eruption as a cooldown is primarily focused around Void Bolt, which doesn&#x27;t have any direct synergies with Voidweaver. We only rarely will reach maximum extension of the rift duration from very lucky procs, and by doing so we are de-prioritizing Void Bolts.</p>
<p>For other builds that do not use Void Eruption the Rift itself brings a much welcomed pacing into the build that feels like you are working towards something. That something is still a bit uninspiring at the current size of the rift, but that was covered in a different section. Expanding the rift size in general feels lackluster as a Shadow Priest (much better as Discipline).</p>
<p>I think there should be some kind of sweet spot the build lives where expanding the rifts size should feel exciting and rewarding, and the extension of the rift duration should be easy to get a few casts, and reward players that are more skillful with the full extension. For Shadow Priests the rift expansion is extremely underwhelming and it feels like we can almost never get the full duration extension off, even while playing perfectly.</p>
<h1>Opener Concerns and Setup Time</h1>
<p>Another point I didn&#x27;t get to focus on earlier was the opener itself into the Entropic Rift. As a goal we are encouraged to have our DoTs active before pressing Void Torrent, but with how we start off pulls currently we are heavily incentivized to just cast Void Torrent for one tick and then cancel to spawn the rift just to get into the start of our opener. Casting Void Torrent just into Vampiric Touch and Shadow Word: Pain on the opener just isn&#x27;t worth full channeling, and sitting there building up to 45/50/55 Insanity for Devouring Plague (depending on talents) is quite a long wait for our cooldown cycle.</p>
<p>This is certainly part of tuning overall, but is something we are noticing with the opener and setup of a Voidweaver Shadow Priest that is a bit awkward to play with currently.</p>
<h1>Pathing and Build Diversity</h1>
<p>The other big thing related to this is how the tree is currently pressuring you to not only pickup Void Torrent, Malediction, and Idol of C&#x27;Thun in the bottom section, but talents like Depth of Shadows or Voidwraith also pull you towards Mindbender, Inescapable Torment, and Idol of Y&#x27;Shaarj (assuming bugs are worked out/intended to work with these). Mastermind is also an extremely valuable point with any build due to the strength of Void Blast.</p>
<p>Encouraging and locking into the bottom right section is totally expected with the core of Entropic Rift, but it just gets a bit much when we are also heavily encouraged to path on the complete opposite side of the tree, not to mention thematically the Shadow Word: Death and Pet-focused spells don&#x27;t exactly fit the Void theme as well as other nodes.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/bookofshadows/blog/tags/alpha">alpha</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/bookofshadows/blog/tags/voidweaver">voidweaver</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Book of Shadows</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/bookofshadows/compendium">Compendium</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://warcraftpriests.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">WarcraftPriests<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://warcraftpriests.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Sim Charts<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discord.gg/WarcraftPriests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/WarcraftPriests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/bookofshadows/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/warcraftpriests/bookofshadows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2024 WarcraftPriests.
