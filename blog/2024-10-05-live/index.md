# October 8th/9th Changes
Voidweaver has received lots of buffs to its kit which when using the right talent build and optimized gear can end up being better than Archon in certain situations. When comparing the best builds Voidweaver is up to **1%** ahead of Archon, meaning they are very close.

There are a few keys things to note:
- Unfurling Darkness is now strongly preferred for Voidweaver builds in non-dungeon environments. This supplements our DoT refreshing instead of relying on Mental Decay and also gives us an instant cast spell.
- By default SimC will cause a certain percentage of ticks of Entropic Rift to miss, this is aimed at making it more realistic with boss and target movement. Chance is 5% on single target and up to 10% above 2 targets.
- Voidweaver will naturally struggle as you go into dungeons and start pulling massive packs together, anything more than 8 targets is rough. For this reason pushing keys will still prefer Archon most weeks, but any type of pug situation where you are pulling one pack a time will do great with Voidweaver, especially during Voidbound weeks.

# When to pick Archon?
- Consistent single target damage, not contingent on targets staying in place.
- Prefers the Void Eruption playstyle
- Mythic+ Dungeons where you are pushing high key levels where packs are living 60+ seconds long or you are consistently pulling packs together and around your cooldowns.

# When to pick Voidweaver?
- Top single target damage, particularly when bosses are not moving out of Entropic Rift.
- Prefers the Dark Ascension playstyle
- Mythic+ Dungeons where you are pulling one pack at a time and not chain pulling massive pulls. Ideally stays at/under 8 targets as much as possible.
- Anytime you are fighting against absorb shields for Devour Matter (i.e. Voidbound affix, Queen Ansurek intermission, etc)
