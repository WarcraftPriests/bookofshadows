# October 8th/9th Changes
Voidweaver has received lots of buffs to its kit which when using the right talent build and optimized gear can end up being better than Archon in certain situations. When comparing the best builds Voidweaver is up to **1%** ahead of Archon, meaning they are very close.

**THINGS ARE STILL BEING TESTED**

It takes us a long time to sim talent builds, especially with rotational changes. Having only gotten this on Friday night we are still working on things and the below information should be treated as **EARLY** information.

# List of Changes
- [Mind Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=8092/mind-blast) damage increased by 10%.
- [Shadow Word: Death](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=32379/shadow-word-death) damage increased by 10%.
- [Void Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205448/void-bolt) damage increased by 10%.
- [Shadowy Apparition](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341263/shadowy-apparition) damage increased by 10%.
- Voidweaver: [Entropic Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447444/entropic-rift) damage increased by 10%.
- Voidweaver: [Void Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450405/void-blast) damage increased by 20%.
- Voidweaver: [Collapsing Void](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=448403/collapsing-void) damage increased by 10%.
- Voidweaver: [Voidwraith](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=451234/voidwraith) damage increased by 10%.
- Voidweaver: [Inner Quietus](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=448278/inner-quietus) now increases [Vampiric Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=34914/vampiric-touch) and [Shadow Word: Pain](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=589/shadow-word-pain) damage by 25% (was 20%).

## How big are these buffs?
- Archon Single: +2.8%
- Voidweaver Single: +5.2%
- Archon Triple Idol AoE: +2.2%
- Archon Hybrid AoE: +2.2%
- Voidweaver AoE: +3.9%

# Overview
There are a few keys things to note:
- [Unfurling Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341273/unfurling-darkness) is now strongly preferred for Voidweaver builds in non-dungeon environments. This supplements our DoT refreshing instead of relying on [Mental Decay](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375994/mental-decay) and also gives us an instant cast spell thats hits like a truck.
- By default SimC will cause a certain percentage of ticks of [Entropic Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447444/entropic-rift) to miss, this is aimed at making it more realistic with boss and target movement. Chance is 5% on single target and up to 10% above 2 targets.
- Voidweaver will naturally struggle as you go into dungeons and start pulling massive packs together, anything more than 8 targets is rough. For this reason pushing keys will still prefer Archon most weeks, but any type of pug situation where you are pulling one pack a time will do great with Voidweaver, especially during [Voidbound](https://www.wowhead.com/affix=158/xalataths-bargain-voidbound) weeks.

## When to pick Archon?
- Consistent single target damage, not contingent on targets staying in place.
- Prefers the [Void Eruption](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=228260/void-eruption) playstyle
- Mythic+ Dungeons where you are pushing high key levels where packs are living 60+ seconds long or you are consistently pulling packs together and around your cooldowns.

## When to pick Voidweaver?
- Top single target damage, particularly when bosses are not moving out of [Entropic Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447444/entropic-rift). This is contingent on playing [Unfurling Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341273/unfurling-darkness). If you do not want to play with this talent than Archon will net more single target damage.
- Prefers the [Dark Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109/dark-ascension) playstyle
- Mythic+ Dungeons where you are pulling one pack at a time and not chain pulling massive pulls. Ideally stays at/under 8 targets as much as possible.
- Anytime you are fighting against absorb shields for [Devour Matter](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=451840/devour-matter) (i.e. [Voidbound](https://www.wowhead.com/affix=158/xalataths-bargain-voidbound) affix, Queen Ansurek intermission, etc)

# Rotation Changes
The following is a list of changes done [to the APL](https://github.com/WarcraftPriests/tww-shadow-priest/commit/04ae29b302878e564879f8db1a060993b31e14de#diff-65271d6253b4d5d7711a953aab2f90f9ff8ad90db3ccbe0df8f7ac6a4fa91511) compared to before these changes. This is not a full list of how to play Voidweaver.
- Pool for 1 GCD with [Mind Flay](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=15407/mind-flay) or 2 GCDs with [Mind Spike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73510/mind-spike) builds before [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=263165/void-torrent) comes off cooldown with Voidweaver
- You should cast [Vampiric Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=34914/vampiric-touch) to spend [Unfurling Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341273/unfurling-darkness) below [Void Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205448/void-bolt) but above [Surge of Insanity](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391399/surge-of-insanity), [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=263165/void-torrent), or [Mind Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=8092/mind-blast).
- As Voidweaver you should cast [Vampiric Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=34914/vampiric-touch) to proc [Unfurling Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341273/unfurling-darkness) when facing less than 6 targets and dark ascension is not active. This falls just above normal [Mind Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=8092/mind-blast) in the priority list.
- Removed unlocked [Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=335467/devouring-plague) use during [Dark Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391109/dark-ascension) and instead unlocked it while [Entropic Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447444/entropic-rift) is active specifically. You still use [Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=335467/devouring-plague) at high priority if it is about to expire or you are capping on Insanity.

3. Cast [Vampiric Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=34914/vampiric-touch) again to consume [Unfurling Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=341273/unfurling-darkness)
