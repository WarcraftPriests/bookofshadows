New capstone talent row:
- Void Apparitions: When an effect from an Idol is activated, conjure Shadowy Apparitions
- Void Apparitions: Shadowy Apparitions have a chance to become empowered and deal more damage and send out a Void Bolt at their target. Unsure if this Void Bolt refreshes DoTs
- Void Apparitions: Tentacle Slam has a 100% chance to activate an effect from one of your idols.

## UI and Addons
[Combat Addons will be disabled](https://www.wowhead.com/news/combat-addons-disabled-in-end-game-content-in-midnight-378679?utm_source=discord-webhook).

This means that many things you rely on for tracking will have to change. Basically anything that accesses Combat Log events will likely stop working and you will need to rely on the default UI to track these things.

While we do not know all specifics it is likely that things like Plater nameplate mods or Weak Auras that track buffs/debuffs will no longer function. Hopefully we get more details soon.

The biggest thing here is to give feedback on what we rely on addons for that is no longer working. The biggest things that come to mind are:
- Tracking if every mob in a pack has DoTs active
- Duration of DoTs on your current target to know optimal refresh times
