# Midnight Changes for Shadow Priests

> The following changes are focused on simplifying some of the cooldown launch sequence as well as the frequent number of high priority procs in the rotation for Shadow. We are also updating the fantasy and visuals of their core spells to create a consistent theme of using the power of the Old Gods to haunt your enemies.

#### Apex Talents: Void Apparitions
1. [Void Apparitions](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1264096/void-apparitions) - When an effect from an Idol is activated, conjure [Shadowy Apparitions](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=341263/shadowy-apparition)
2. [Void Apparitions](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1264104/void-apparitions) - [Shadowy Apparitions](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=341263/shadowy-apparition) have a chance to become empowered and deal more damage and send out a [Void Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=205448/void-bolt) at their target. This [Void Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205448/void-bolt) does NOT refresh DoTs
3. [Void Apparitions](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1264107/void-apparitions) - [Tentacle Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1227280/tentacle-slam) has a 100% chance to activate an effect from one of your idols (does not require it to be talented).

## FAQ

### How will Mass AoE Work?
With the changes that remove [Void Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205448/void-bolt) and its ability to refresh DoT effects this is a massive gap we have right now in our kit.

## UI and Addons
[Combat Addons will be disabled](https://www.wowhead.com/news/combat-addons-disabled-in-end-game-content-in-midnight-378679?utm_source=discord-webhook).

This means that many things you rely on for tracking will have to change. Basically anything that accesses Combat Log events will likely stop working and you will need to rely on the default UI to track these things.

While we do not know all specifics it is likely that things like Plater nameplate mods or Weak Auras that track buffs/debuffs will no longer function. Hopefully we get more details soon.

The biggest thing here is to give feedback on what we rely on addons for that is no longer working. The biggest things that come to mind are:
- Tracking if every mob in a pack has DoTs active
- Duration of DoTs on your current target to know optimal refresh times (Only works for [Shadow Word: Madness](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=335467/shadow-word-madness) currently)
