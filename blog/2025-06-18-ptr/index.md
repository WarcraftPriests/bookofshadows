# 11.2 Changes
Below is my initial reaction to changes on the 11.2 PTR for Shadow Priests.
- [List of Data-mined Changes](https://www.wowhead.com/news/patch-11-2-ptr-datamined-class-changes-build-61476-protection-warrior-and-hunter-377342) and [Patch Notes](https://www.wowhead.com/news/patch-11-2-ghosts-of-karesh-ptr-development-notes-377345?utm_source=discord-webhook)
- [Season 3 Set Bonuses](https://www.wowhead.com/news/all-season-3-tier-set-bonuses-datamined-377338#priest)

## Gameplay Changes
Overall this patch has lots of design changes of how we deal damage but realistically gameplay wise the changes are quite tame, which makes sense for a mid-expansion rework. The major gameplay changes you will notice are:
- [Mind Spike](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=73510/mind-spike) has been removed
- [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash) 15s CD 2 charges 6 targets baseline. [Whispering Shadows](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=406777/whispering-shadows) functionality merged into the base spell.
- [Void Volley](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1240401/void-volley) new active
- [Malediction](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373221/malediction) has been removed and is now baseline into [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent) making [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent) a 30 second cooldown.
- [Unfurling Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=341273/unfurling-darkness) has been removed.
- [Shadowy Apparitions](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=341491/shadowy-apparitions) can now critically strike independently of the spell that procced them.
- Base [Mind Flay](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=15407/mind-flay) damage and Insanity has been buffed and [Mind Flay: Insanity](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=391403/mind-flay-insanity) had its Insanity generation nerfed.
- [Deathspeaker](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=392507/deathspeaker) is now a fully passive talent instead of a proc.

## Questions
Below is the list of questions the community has with unclear interactions or changes coming in 11.2.
- Proc chance for [Tormented Spirits](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=391284/tormented-spirits) is unknown.

## Problems Ignored
While the list of changes is overall pretty positive I was disappointed that a few of the issues the spec has went unaddressed this patch. Below are the big ones I feel still could use adjustments.
- Utility choice in top section
- Baseline [Shadowfiend](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=34433/shadowfiend)/[Mindbender](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=123040/mindbender) damage
- [Dark Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=391109/dark-ascension) vs. [Void Eruption](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=228260/void-eruption)
- Movement/displacement improvements

## Pathing Issues
Below is the list of current pathing issues I noticed with the talent tree redesign and where these nodes feel out of place in their current design and/or place on the tree in general. All of these options are also difficult to take/path into in their current state.
- [Dark Evangelism](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=391099/dark-evangelism) off of [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash).
- [Madness Weaving](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1240394/madness-weaving)
- [Idol of Y'Shaarj](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=373310/idol-of-yshaarj)

## Tier Set
Overall the sets seem pretty powerful numbers wise but still need to play-test them to see how they feel. First reaction is fairly positive!

### Archon
- 2pc: [Halo](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=120644/halo)s generate an additional 10 Insanity over 5 sec and [Resonant Energy](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=453850/resonant-energy) additionally increases the damage of your [Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=335467/devouring-plague) by 5.0%.
- 4pc: While [Power Surge](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=453109/power-surge) is active, every 2 casts of [Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=335467/devouring-plague) adds another [Halo](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=120644/halo) to the effect at 100% effectiveness, up to 2 times.

### Voidweaver
This tier set will likely eliminate the need to pool [Mind Blasts](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=8092/mind-blast) before casting [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent).

- 2pc: [Void Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=450405/void-blast) damage is increased by 40% and [Void Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=450405/void-blast)'s cast time is reduced by 20%. [Void Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=450405/void-blast)'s cooldown is reduced by 50%.
- 4pc: [Void Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=450405/void-blast) now also causes [Entropic Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=447444/entropic-rift) to grow, [Collapsing Void](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=448403/collapsing-void) increases [Entropic Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=447444/entropic-rift)'s damage by an additional 20%, and the damage of your next [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent) is increased by up to 200% based on the size of [Entropic Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=447444/entropic-rift) when it collapses.

## Talent Changes
In this section I'm going to quickly touch on the changes and give my reaction to them.

- [Dark Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=391109/dark-ascension)
  - This talent still existing feels extra out of place now that [Mind Spike](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=73510/mind-spike) was removed since our only filler spell is now not buffed with this cooldown, particularly with [Surge of Insanity](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=391399/surge-of-insanity) procs.
- [Subservient Shadows](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1228516/subservient-shadows)
  - Most of the value comes from [Idol of C'Thun](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=377349/idol-of-cthun)/[Idol of Yogg-Saron](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=373273/idol-of-yogg-saron) and not [Shadowfiend](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=34433/shadowfiend) or [Mindbender](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=123040/mindbender). With this current identity it feels a bit misplaced on the tree.
  - This talent does not work with [Depth of Shadows](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=451308/depth-of-shadows) (duration effect)
  - [Shadowfiend](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=34433/shadowfiend) and [Mindbender](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=123040/mindbender) being weak baseline is likely contributing to it feeling underwhelming in this current spot.
- [Madness Weaving](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1240394/madness-weaving)
  - Feels pretty lackluster given its place on the talent tree.
  - Weird way to buff [Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=335467/devouring-plague)
  - The spec already likes mastery so its functionality feels misplaced and is not very clear to the average player.
- [Death's Torment](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1240364/deaths-torment)
  - Pathing feels like a good spot off of [Deathspeaker](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=392507/deathspeaker) and the echoes stacking [Idol of N'Zoth](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=373280/idol-of-nzoth) feels like a good pathing interaction
- [Deathspeaker](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=392507/deathspeaker)
  - losing the movement global is a bit disappointing, wish we still had the proc version as a choice node
  - Really begins to highlight how weak Shadow Word: Death is baseline
  - While this talent on live does interact with [Depth of Shadows](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=451308/depth-of-shadows) this current iteration does not. Without adjusting that talent as well we have this weird zone between 35% and 20% health where we have different execute interactions which makes things feel confusing.
- [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash)
  - Cooldown/charges changes overall feel positive
  - With the removal of [Deathspeaker](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=392507/deathspeaker) as a movement global getting this as a pathing node into [Void Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=263165/void-torrent) can be a decent alternative with [Descending Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1242666/descending-darkness). Unsure how it will feel weaving in [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash) on single target.
- [Descending Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1242666/descending-darkness)
  - while optimizing [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash) damage does give us yet another form of AoE you now have a conflicted sense of using it solely for DoT spreading or Damage. I personally liked not feeling pressured to use it on cooldown but rather being able to mostly just save it for DoTing purposes, and now this is a bit conflicting.
  - On fresh targets DoTs are applied after [Shadow Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=205385/shadow-crash) deals damage so you lose out on the Mastery modifier here which feels bad, another reason why making this a damage spell is awkward.
- [Void Volley](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1240401/void-volley)
  - not using its own keybind is awesome
  - this spell is just super cool and I love it
- [Idol of N'Zoth](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=373280/idol-of-nzoth)
  - tooltip is very confusing
  - insanity generation buffs are currently hidden from your buff bar and combat log
  - [Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=335467/devouring-plague) gives 12 stacks regardless of [Mind's Eye](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=407470/minds-eye) vs. [Distorted Reality](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=409044/distorted-reality), potentially an oversight?
- [Idol of Y'Shaarj](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=373310/idol-of-yshaarj)
  - This really has nothing to do with pets and does feels out of place on the tree for what it was reworked into.
  - The pathing talents are all pet related, and this talent proccing haste emphasizes a known issue with the game not updating pet melee-swing time in real-time after you get a haste proc. Pets update on a slower interval (roughly ~3 seconds) which makes this node feel even more out of place.
  - feels very feast or famine gameplay which is not typical of this spec.
