Decided to wrap up some previous posts and feedback into a more concise entry to give current good, bad, and bugs for Voidweaver and Archon from a Shadow Priest perspective.

# State of Voidweaver
## Good
- Visually exciting
- Mini-bursts every 30s feel nice
- Cast while moving Void Torrent is fun to play with

## Bad
- Shadowy Insight procs can be frustrating as we pool Mind Blasts before our Void Torrent and waste these procs.
- Travel time to getting to the target can be frustrating, would feel much better if it just spawned under the target.
- Pooling Mind Blasts before Void Torrents can be awkward
- Slowly follows the target if its moving across the room too fast
- Feels like we need to play around Mind Melt a bit too much
- Lack of Void interactions on the tree, particularly Voidform. Instead we have several points that deal with Mindbender, SW:D, or dots
- Retargeting when original target dies feels really random
- Devour Matter can be good in niche cases, but feels bad that most of the time it does nothing

## Gamebreaking Bugs
- Void Blast sometimes breaks
- Voidwraith gets 1-shot by most environmental AoE effects
- Darkening Horizon doesnt always work correctly

# State of Archon
## Good
- Off-healing can be quite powerful
- If you like Halo, it is cool to see the bursts
- Simple to play, if you like base shadow you will like Archon

## Bad
- Puts a weird amount of emphasis on MFI/MSI
- Does not make our cooldowns feel that powerful
- Can feel overwhemled trying to spend Surge procs before capping, particularly with VF
- Honestly quite boring relative to Voidweaver
- Halo itself is pretty weak baseline, especially since the echoes do not give Insanity

## Gamebreaking Bugs
- Mind Spike can munch free Surge of Insanity procs
