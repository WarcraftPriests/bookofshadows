## Shadow Priest Feedback

### Major Cooldown Design
All the way back in the [Dragonflight development cycle](https://www.bluetracker.gg/wow/topic/us-en/1279512-feedback-priests/) it was mentioned that our cooldowns would be looked at in a future patch. Several patches later the problems with Dark Ascension and Void Eruption as a choice node is still present in our spec tree.

Dark Ascension is incredibly simple in its design, and has little cohesion with our overall spec or talent tree design. This has recently become even worse with the removal of Mind Spike, which felt like it was the defacto filler to pick with Dark Ascension. In its current state I just do not understand why this is still in the game, I would much rather have a choice node that modifies Void Eruption instead of Dark Ascension (see below).

Being able to pick between a 1-minute Shadow Priest compared to a 2-minute Shadow Priest is a really cool concept. However, since these are separate cooldowns today there is a severe lack of cohesion with the rest of our kit since spells need to work with both. This also limits the design options you have with our cooldowns.

At this point Void Eruption is a much more interesting cooldown and I would prefer focusing Shadow Priests on that cooldown over Dark Ascension. Exploring past ideas like ramping DoT damage or haste as Voidform goes on would be cool to see in the modern game, but just is not possible as long as Dark Ascension still exists to balance Void Eruption against.

Note that if Dark Ascension did go away it would mean a lot to the community to get a glyph that altered Voidform's animation to be the Dark Ascension wings. 

### DoT Maintenance and Application
- Shadow Crash
  - changes are amazing for raid
  - kinda mid/doesn't matter for dungeons
  - somewhat buggy/inconsistent on large packs

### Utility Nodes in the Spec Tree
Currently Shadow Priests have to choose 2 utility points in the top section of our talent tree before moving onto the middle section after picking all the damage nodes.

This creates a problem, as we are limited to 2 of the 4 of these nodes without losing DPS by sacrificing points in the rest of the tree.
- Dispersion
- Silence
- Intangibility or Mental Fortitude
- Last Word or Psychic Horror

For most content we always want to have Dispersion. This leaves effectively just one point left, which typically we players will choose Mental Fortitude to counter the squishy nature of playing a Priest. This means we are effectively choosing between losing defensive utility, our interrupt, or DPS with this choice.

If Dispersion and/or Silence were just made baseline for Shadow Priests this issue goes away.

### Spec Tree Pathing Issues
- The Shadow Crash path is only 2 points to get to Void Torrent. The alternative option is 3 points which inherently puts these nodes at a disadvantage.
- Points in a weird spot:
  - Madness Weaving
  - Dark Evangelism
  - Idol of Y'Shaarj (rework please im begging)
- Number of 2 point nodes is still the highest in the game
- Plagued by lots of numerically weak nodes that do not change your gameplay or others that are super niche. These cause our pathing to be restricted
- Core Shadow Priest Themes are not always easy to path or there are too few choices.

### Mobility, Movement, and Utility

#### Mobility and Movement
Shadow Priests have long been known for their mobility issues, which is still [very much relevant](https://www.twitch.tv/publikpriest/clip/OptimisticAmericanSalsifyGrammarKing-ifxkZMx8sCOrUrd3) in Season 3 of The War Within. 

The only way Shadow Priests can actually counter this kind of mobility problem is to pay for a race change. Dractyhr, Goblin, and Void Elf become our only way to get meaningful movement displacement when other classes have this built into their kit. Nothing in the changes coming in Season 3 make this problem better. Vault of the Heavens or Door of Shadows in the Priest tree please?

#### Utility
The other topic that is still painful is our classes group utility. Often times the only thing that makes Priests stick out from the crowd is Power Word: Fortitude, something that Holy and Discipline also bring in addition to Shadow Priests. Giving Shadow some of its own identity when it comes to utility would go a long way.

Shadow Priests do get value out of Vampiric Embrace that Holy and Discipline do not, but this ability has its own flaws that often do not make it valuable. The two big ones are the "smart" heal aspect of Vampiric Embrace being pretty dumb and it being hard to press on-demand when the group actually needs healing. To get good healing out of this we need to be doing good damage, lining this up is typically not something Priests do in this day and age. Would rather the spell just be passive Leech for my party, or something that I can control more that is not tied to my damage as much.

The other big problem with Shadow Priests is how it relates in the current Mythic+ Group Composition meta. There are different requirements for what a healer or dps should bring to a group, and generally speaking our group utility for control is niche and typically weaker than our ranged dps counterparts.
- Shackle Undead usually has incredibly niche to no value every season in Mythic+
  - Why can't this work for more enemy types? Or just call it "Shackle"?
- Psychic Horror is a severe DPS loss to take (see above section on spec tree utility points)
- Silence is arguably the worst interrupt in the game for Mythic+ content. Often times the Silence portion of the effect is useless, leading to us just having a long cooldown interrupt.
- Dominate Mind is either totally gamebreakingly overpowered or useless.
- Psychic Scream is pulling a lot of weight for us right now as an AoE stop, unfortunately we do have to play in melee to use it though. This was a big problem solved by Mind Bomb (particularly in its stun version) that I still miss to this day
- Mass Dispel has not only seen significant nerfs, there has also been a notable change in dungeon design limiting its use cases
- Void Tendrils goes most seasons with most players forgetting it even exists it is so niche and often useless

Priests have had plenty of utility spells in the past that were useful, but not gamebreaking that have been taken away from us. Bringing some of these back or shoring up existing utility problems would go a long way to groups being excited about inviting a Shadow Priest into their group.
